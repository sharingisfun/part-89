A respect for one another's work ethic, musical proficiency, stylistic taste and of course, for each other as people.\n\nThe concept of blindness, be it willing, involuntary, inherent or otherwise is so foreign and far removed from anything within the realm of experience for these men. However as the process has begun to create this music, it has become apparent how limited one's own vision can be when staring at the broad side of limitless potential and ambition. \n\nWith the musical vision of Dave Sheldon (ex Man With Target, Annihilator) and the lyrical conception of vocalist and frontman Big James (Endast, Authors) the project is very quickly taking shape into something more than either anticipated. The hope is to see the world of metal in a new light, with EXES FOR EYES.\n\nTongues Like Figure Eights features eleven assaulting tracks that include guest appearances by Bjorn Strid of Soilwork, Lisa Sinner of Out of The Ruins and Dominic Cifarelli of Chronicles of IsrafelScars On Broadway.\n\nExes For Eyes is:\n\nBig James Arsenian Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals\n\nDave Sheldon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitars, Vocals\n\nGraham Porter- Bass\n\nAaron Spink Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\nProduced by Dave Sheldon\n\n\n\nApril 26th, 2011 - The Amsler Grid\n\n1.

I'm certain they'll gladly appreciate it, as it costs them money to record, to travel to perform, etc. and have bills to pay like everyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf993352ccb0f4327c3ab672c72b910c2e6ec07d","amp;dn":"Exes+For+Eyes+-+Discography+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf993352ccb0f4327c3ab672c72b910c2e6ec07d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,153,51,82,204,176,244,50,124,58,182,114,199,43,145,12,46,110,192,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
