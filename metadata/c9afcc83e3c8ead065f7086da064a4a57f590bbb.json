Conservation and efficient\nreuse of this precious and versatile resource are mandatory\nif such areas are to achieve proper development. And, the\nneed for water conservation does not limit itself only to arid\nregions. Recognition of the detrimental environmental impact\nof high temperature water discharge into an estuary, whose\ninhabitants are accustomed to more moderate temperature\nlevels, makes one realize that the re-cooling and reuse of\nwater, however abundant, conserves not just that important\nnatural resourceÃ¢â‚¬â€it conserves nature as well. One helpful\nmeans to that end is the water cooling tower.\nThose responsible for the specifications, purchasing and\noperation of plant, station, or building cooling systems must\nconsider many aspects beyond the primary requirement of\ndissipating unwanted heat. The following text is devoted\nto identifying the primary and peripheral considerations\nand offering approaches refined by some eighty years of\nexperience in the cooling tower industry. The goal is to\nassure the implementation of water cooling systems which\nwill satisfy all design and environmental requirements with\nsound engineering and responsible cost.\nThis manual is not intended to be all-encompassing and\nthoroughly definitive. The entire scope of cooling towers is\ntoo broad, and the technology far too advanced, to permit\ncomplete coverage in a single publication. Separate brochures\nby SPX Cooling Technologies, either existing or planned, cover\nindividual topics in depth. The intent herein is to provide a\nlevel of basic knowledge which will facilitate dialogue, and\nunderstanding, between user and manufacturer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9afcc83e3c8ead065f7086da064a4a57f590bbb","amp;dn":"Cooling+Tower+Fundamentals+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9afcc83e3c8ead065f7086da064a4a57f590bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,175,204,131,227,200,234,208,101,247,8,109,160,100,164,165,127,89,11,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
