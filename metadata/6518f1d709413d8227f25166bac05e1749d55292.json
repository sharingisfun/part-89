Well, straighter. Although heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happy to run alcohol guns wherever the moneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s good, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think the world needs more sap, or its increasingly ugly side-effects. But becoming legit is easier said than done, and ClyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first legal gigÃ¢â‚¬â€a supply run for the Seattle UndergroundÃ¢â‚¬â€will be paid for by sap money.\n\nNew Orleans is not ClyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first pick for a shopping run. He loved the Big Easy once, back when he also loved a beautiful mixed-race prostitute named Josephine EarlyÃ¢â‚¬â€but that was a decade ago, and he hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looked back since. JoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still thinking about him, though, or so he learns when he gets a telegram about a peculiar piloting job. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a chance to complete two lucrative jobs at once, one he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refuse. He sends his old paramour a note and heads for New Orleans, with no idea of what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in forÃ¢â‚¬â€or what she wants him to fly.\n\nBut he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be flying. Not exactly. Hidden at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain lurks an astonishing war machine, an immense submersible called the Ganymede. This prototype could end the war, if only anyone had the faintest idea of how to operate itÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. If only they could sneak it past the Southern forces at the mouth of the Mississippi RiverÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ If only it hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t killed most of the men whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever set foot inside it. \n\n\nRead by GraphicAudio (full cast)\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 256 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6518f1d709413d8227f25166bac05e1749d55292","amp;dn":"Cherie+Priest+-+Ganymede+%28The+Clockwork+Century+%233%29+%5BGraphicAudi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6518f1d709413d8227f25166bac05e1749d55292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,24,241,215,9,65,61,130,39,242,81,102,186,192,94,23,73,213,82,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
