It's April 1, and Bluto plays a series of &quot;jokes&quot; on Popeye, though of course they go beyond the bounds of acceptability, particularly once they get to the picnic grounds; Bluto puts gasoline on the fire he asks Popeye to light and swaps a beehive for the lemonade. Bluto then launches a cruel joke against Olive and frames Popeye. The capper: he replaces Popeye's spinach with a joke can, and runs off with Olive for some canoeing. But Popeye gets the last laugh with an inflatable sea monster. \n\n\nDirector:\nIzzy Sparber (as I.
