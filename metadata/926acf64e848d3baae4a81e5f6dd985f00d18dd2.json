A handful of its landmarks, such as the Kremlin and St Basil's Cathedral, are instantly recognizable across the world, but relatively few people have seen the interiors of these celebrated buildings or have an inkling of the multitude of other architectural jewels hiding behind Moscow's public facade. Indeed, until the emergence of glasnost this richness and diversity remained largely unknown even to Muscovites. This is an illustrated guide to the vast variety of buildings spread across the city. Opulent former palaces of the Tsars stand next to ordinary apartment blocks; richly appointed Orthodox churches are set alongside modern constructivist buildings or the cold grandeur of the Metro; splendidly redecorated hotels co-exist with shops as ornate as Harrods' food hall - although regrettably lacking the same range of goods.
