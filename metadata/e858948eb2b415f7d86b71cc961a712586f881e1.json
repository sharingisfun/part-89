A young couple nearing a crossroad in their lives. A terminally ill conductor, with only three months to live. A couple on the verge of divorce, with a teenage daughter, hellbent on bringing them back together. A recently released prisoner, and finally a nefarious black market dealer.\nThey're met by the proprietor Mr. Rhys and his lovely daughter, Gwyneth, who both seem strangely aloof, as if they're not really there. Soon the travellers realize something is wrong. Why are all newspapers a year old? Why is there no sign of the terrible fire that destroyed the inn a while back? Why doesn't Mr. Rhys have a reflection?\n\nFind your room in a hurry and get your bags unpacked. You don't want to miss this.\nI really can't recommend The Halfway House enough: unlike the more overt Ealing war films (which this resembles in many ways, not least the disparate group coming together and working together), this is subtler propaganda, and its overarching supernatural atmosphere is well-done. Apart from that, however, it offers strong character portraits, great visual flourishes, and another solid turn from Johns, confirming my sense of him as Ealing's most valuable player at this stage of its life.\n\nReal life father and daughter Merwyn and Glynis Johns play a father and daughter in the movie.\n\nToday's viewers have the luxury of going back in time for a few hours and then leaving - audiences of the time could not shake off the film's ideas so easily, and its impact in 1944 would have been much greater than on someone watching it seventy years later.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 724mb\nDuration.... 01:32:02\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 640\nFrame Height.... 464\nData Rate.... 970kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 126kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e858948eb2b415f7d86b71cc961a712586f881e1","amp;dn":"The+Halfway+House+1944+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e858948eb2b415f7d86b71cc961a712586f881e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,88,148,142,178,180,21,247,216,107,113,204,150,26,113,37,134,248,129,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
