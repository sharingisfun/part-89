Hope you like it\n\nAhem, Ladies and Gentlemen....and my best friend Josh Smith,\n\nPresenting to you,\n\nCross Ange - Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo - Complete soundtrack.\n\nThis set contains:\n1- The first Volume of Cross Ange OST\n2- The second volume of Cross Ange OST\n3- The third volume of Cross Ange OST\n4- Extras\n\n[NOTE]: The Extras were added because the OST 1,2 or 3 Do NOT contain:\n1-The Opening Theme 1 &quot;Kaidan no Resistance&quot;\n2-The Opening Theme 2 &quot;Sinjitsu no Mokushitoku&quot;\n3-The Ending Theme 1 &quot;Rinrei&quot;\n4-The Ending Theme 2 &quot;Shuumatsu No Love song&quot;\n5-Necessary (Song played in episodes)\n\nSo it pretty much concludes that they inserted the episode soundtracks into the packs but sold all the OPs and EDs sperarately. But I looked up for the opening and endings and found the whole volumes. Therefore, with each OP or ED pack, you'll find some extra songs (NOT from Cross Ange).\nSo you get the WHOLE Cross Ange OST AND extra!\n\nPlease seed.\nAND if you have any question, can't find a piece of music?\nContact me at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ecf4bdc5576241e12796e833179e959b62ffcf3","amp;dn":"%5BCROSS+ANGE%5D+-+Complete+OST+%281%2B2%2B3%29+With+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ecf4bdc5576241e12796e833179e959b62ffcf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,207,75,220,85,118,36,30,18,121,110,131,49,121,233,89,182,47,252,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
