You're probably thinking Steve Jobs, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford. The usual suspects. This book isn't about them. It's about people you've never heard of. It's about people who are just as innovative, entrepreneurial, and visionary as the Jobses, Edisons, and Fords of the world. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in the crowded streets of Shenzhen, the prisons of Somalia, the flooded coastal towns of Thailand. They are pirates, computer hackers, pranksters, and former gang leaders. Across the globe, diverse innovators operating in the black, grey, and informal economies are developing solutions to a myriad of challenges. Far from being &quot;deviant entrepreneurs&quot; that pose threats to our social and economic stability, these innovators display remarkable ingenuity, pioneering original methods and practices that we can learn from and apply to move formal markets. This book investigates the stories of underground innovation that make up the Misfit Economy. It examines the teeming genius of the underground. It asks: Who are these unknown visionaries? How do they work? How do they organize themselves? How do they catalyze innovation? And ultimately, how can you take these lessons into your own world?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9103ea6e1fce5c3df1af33e551191ae465669a1","amp;dn":"Alexa+Clay+-+The+Misfit+Economy+%282015%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9103ea6e1fce5c3df1af33e551191ae465669a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,16,62,166,225,252,229,195,223,26,243,62,85,17,145,174,70,86,105,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
