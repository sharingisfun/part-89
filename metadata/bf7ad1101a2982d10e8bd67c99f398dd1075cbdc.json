You may also have seen his books: &quot;Designing a Layout&quot; and &quot;Landscape Modelling&quot;\n\nIn this, the first of two programmes, Barry shows how he lays the basis for his excellent model railway scenes.\n\nBeginning by researching the prototype, he explains the methods he uses to find the details he will need for the completed model.\n\nHe then describes how he designs the layout to include the most interesting aspects of the prototype and show them to their best effect.\n\nHaving designed the layout, he then sets about the more practical aspects of baseboard construction and making landforms before laying , texturing, colouring and detailing the landscape.\n\nLaying, painting and weathering the track area and fencing is covered and the programme closes with a guided photographic tour of his two most well-known layouts. \n\nContents of the DVD\n\nThe DVD contains the following sections: -\n\n Researching the Prototype\n Layout Design\n Baseboard Construction\n Laying Track\n Making Landforms\n Laying Grass\n Colour Mixing\n Landscape Colouring\n Landscape Detailing\n Painting and Weathering Track\n Fencing\n A Guide to Lytham Heath and Petherick \n\nImportant: Resolution = 768 x 576. However, I have encoded these from 8GB to a reasonable uploading size, so there will be the odd loss of definition here and there.\nI used the H265 format, so if you have difficulty playing this file I suggest you download a media player like VLC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf7ad1101a2982d10e8bd67c99f398dd1075cbdc","amp;dn":"Model+Railways+-+Right+Track+5+-+Landscapes+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf7ad1101a2982d10e8bd67c99f398dd1075cbdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,122,209,16,26,41,130,209,14,139,214,124,153,243,152,221,16,117,203,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
