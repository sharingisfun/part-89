Following dinner, Sakura asks about Inari staring at the torn family photo on the wall before the boy runs off with his mother Tsunami chasing after him. Tazuna then explains that the man torn from the picture, named Kaiza, was once a hero in the Land of Waves who Inari looked up to. When Gato arrived, Inari is traumatized when he saw Kaiza executed by Gato's men to serve as an example of anyone who gets in Gato's way.
