Ostensibly a musical documentary on the Eskimo, this is an album of icy atmospheres, poetic electronics, and imaginary landscapes,concocted around a loose narrative told in the liner notes. There's also a subtheme of indigenous populations overrun by western commercialism (is that native chant actually &quot;Coca Cola is Life&quot;?). Ex-Henry Cow member Chris Cutler plays a lot \nof the percussion on the album, especially on the finale, &quot;Festival of Death,&quot; the only real piece of rhythmic music here, which shines out as anything but dark or sinister. In any other group's hands this would have been a pretentious disaster, but the Residents pull it off through spirit, humor, and sheer bravado","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6e7081ccadf5d4851106b33098b4794d28aad77","amp;dn":"The+Residents+-+1979+-+Eskimo+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6e7081ccadf5d4851106b33098b4794d28aad77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,231,8,28,202,223,93,72,81,16,107,51,9,139,71,148,210,138,173,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
