On March 15, 2008, MÃƒÂ¡rquez lost his Super Featherweight title to Pacquiao via split decision. MÃƒÂ¡rquez suffered a knockdown in the third round that proved to be the difference, as the remaining rounds were scored dead even. Compubox scoring had MÃƒÂ¡rquez landing 42 of 201 (21%) jabs to Pacquiao's 43 of 314 (14%) and landing 130 of 310 (42%) power punches to Pacquiao's 114 of 305 (37%). Richard Schaefer, Golden Boy Promotions CEO, offered a $6 million guarantee to Pacquiao for a rematch. Pacquiao's promoter, Bob Arum, said, &quot;I'm not saying they'll never fight again, but you have to let it bake for a while.&quot; Pacquiao said: &quot;I don't think so, this business is over&quot; as he planned to move up to the lightweight division.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52feb9ac68f518979a8c55cefdf8035a374987e4","amp;dn":"Manny+Pacquiao-Juan+Manuel+Marquez+II.wmv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52feb9ac68f518979a8c55cefdf8035a374987e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,254,185,172,104,245,24,151,154,140,85,206,253,248,3,90,55,73,135,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
