As such, it provides a vital understanding of melt and solidification processes, treating all simulation techniques for continuous and discrete systems, such as molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and finite elements calculations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ce5776263ff06e65393b4a28af5af5c89b2d921","amp;dn":"Phase+Transformations+in+Multicomponent+Melts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ce5776263ff06e65393b4a28af5af5c89b2d921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,229,119,98,99,255,6,230,83,147,180,162,138,245,175,92,137,178,217,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
