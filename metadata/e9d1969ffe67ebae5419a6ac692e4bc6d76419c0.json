They definitely listened in music class: Experimenting with varied dynamics and tempos, using effective silences as well as 3 different voice-characters, fast-driven guitars and excellent drums, they managed to accompany meaningful messages with groundbreaking music full of passion and anger.\n\nIn 1999, Red Lights Flash released their debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stop WhenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the vienna based punk label Remedy Records, followed by several shows in Austria and the first touring experiences in Europe. With Ã¢â‚¬Å“And Time Goes ByÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the second full-length in 2002, the band gained the opportunity to release on Householdname Records of London.\n\nThis led Red Lights Flash to three European tours and five UK tours including tour supports for Anti-Flag, Capdown and Good Clean Fun as well as several support slots for bands like Good Riddance, As Friends Rust, Propagandhi, Strike Anywhere, Leftover Crack, Ensign, Union13, Hundred Reasons, Intensity, Grade, Int. Noise Conspiracy, Down By Law, 59 Times The Pain, Dropkick Murphys, Satanic Surfers, Such A Surge, Carthasis, All Systems Go!, Donots, Dillinger4, A.F.I., Strung Out, Diesel Boy, Agnostic Front, The Start and many more.
