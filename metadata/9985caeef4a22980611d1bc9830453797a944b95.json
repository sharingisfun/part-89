I was seven years old and camping with my family.  Everyone at the camp ground had their radio's on and I remember sitting in the truck listening to the news.\n\nIn the days following, my dad had the reel to reel tape recorder running, recording the non stop tribute to Elvis on the radio.  He filled eleven reels and most of them are about an hour and a half.  These tapes sat on the shelf for 36 years until he transferred them to digital files.  He has been urging me to post them on the TPB for everyone to enjoy.\n\nSo here it is.  I will be posting a condensed MP3 version as well as the original WAV version for those who want better sound quality.  I hope many people will enjoy this.
