The plague caused by the war has killed everyone else except for a few hundred deformed, nocturnal people calling themselves &quot;The Family&quot;. The plague has caused them to become sensitive to light, as well as homicidally psychotic. They believe science and technology to be the cause of the war and their punishment, and Neville, as the last symbol of science, the old world, and a &quot;user of the wheel&quot;, must die. Neville, using electricity, machinery, and science attempts to hold them at bay.\n\n\n\n\n***** As Always, My Thanks in advance to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is much appreciated *****\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067525&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067525&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acf21e595e1fe0aacd5cddee8592bf714286d5e4","amp;dn":"The+Omega+Man%281971%29-Multi+Audio%26amp%3BSubs+%28See+Post%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acf21e595e1fe0aacd5cddee8592bf714286d5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,242,30,89,94,31,224,170,205,92,221,238,133,146,191,113,66,134,213,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
