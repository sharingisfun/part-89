The \n\nwhole period was mad! We had a firm belief that we were going to die and the record was made on those terms.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ The whole \n\nthing was designed to express this sort of fear, angst, which the group was all about, really.&quot;[2] The album's subject \n\nmatter also deals with war and imperialism.[3] The cover art reflects these concerns, and includes a photomontage of \n\nimages such as mushroom clouds, thematic maps depicting nuclear arsenals and photographs of Ronald Reagan, Leonid Brezhnev \n\nand Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nAs with other This Heat recordings, much of the album was recorded at Cold Storage, a disused refrigerated storeroom at a \n\nformer meat pie factory in Acre Lane, Brixton, England.[4] The music included new improvisations along with songs the band \n\nhad been playing during live performances (portions of these songs were culled from actual concert recordings).[2][4] As \n\nHayward describes, &quot;some of the album was really plush sounding, some dim and pokey. Sometimes it would sound like the \n\nmachinery was breaking up. We deliberately would make it sound as though the record player was exploding.&quot;[2][a]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5bd951eb7417711cfdad4a8bf9fb620d7da3847","amp;dn":"This+Heat+-+1981+-+Deceit+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5bd951eb7417711cfdad4a8bf9fb620d7da3847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,189,149,30,183,65,119,17,207,218,212,168,191,159,182,32,215,218,56,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
