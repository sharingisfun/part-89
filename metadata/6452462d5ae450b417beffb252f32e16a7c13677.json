The Rifftrax audio track has been newly remastered to ensure the riff comments are just loud enough to be clear when the movie is loud and not too loud when the movie is quiet. Please leave any feedback regarding the Rifftrax audio remastering.\n\nBig thanks to the posters of the 1080p/5.1 encodes of the movies, the subs and the chapters.\n\nIf this Rifftrax was enjoyable, you haven't paid for it and you have a few dollars to spare, please consider purchasing this riff (3.99USD) or make a general donation via CCard, PPal, Bitcoin/Dogecoin/Litecoin or wallet payment apps at  \n\nPlease check out other Rifftrax, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, documentaries, Star Trek Enterprise and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \n &lt;a href=&quot; https://kickass.so/user/bsg4you/uploads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://kickass.so/user/bsg4you/uploads/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6452462d5ae450b417beffb252f32e16a7c13677","amp;dn":"Transformers+Trilogy+2007-2011+1080p+Rifftrax+6ch+2ch+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6452462d5ae450b417beffb252f32e16a7c13677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,82,70,45,90,228,80,180,23,190,255,178,82,243,46,22,167,193,54,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
