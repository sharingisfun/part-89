It uses traditional tower defense elements such as slowing towers, ranged towers and splash towers but involves new elements like frigginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ awesome wizards and all kinds of crazy creeps with their own unique abilities. Use a hand-crafted spell casting system, power ups, and upgrades in an attempt to take down self-healing, teleporting, fire-breathing and just plain mean creeps! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take more than sheer brute force to battle it out with these monsters, it will take strategy, time and a little bit of luck to come out victorious","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30a6aaf540784cb707de7e1ac788bfc0fbc127bc","amp;dn":"Wizards+Alley+Tower+Defense+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30a6aaf540784cb707de7e1ac788bfc0fbc127bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,166,170,245,64,120,76,183,7,222,126,26,199,136,191,192,251,193,39,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
