Their late 1980s and early 1990s years have been described as the period in which they brought forth a &quot;hedonistic rebelliousness&quot; reminiscent of the early Rolling Stones, a reputation that had earned them the nickname &quot;The Most Dangerous Band in the World&quot;. \nThe band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, their first year of eligibility.\n\n\nWelcome To The Jungle\nDon't Cry\nDouble Talkin' Jive\nNovember Rain\nKnockin' On Heaven's Door\nYou Could Be Mine\nNew Rose\nRaw Power\nAin't It Fun\nThis I Love\n\nIn August 2013, a new song titled &quot;Going Down&quot; was leaked online.\nThe track features bassist Tommy Stinson on lead vocals, with Rose providing back up vocals. \nBumblefoot confirmed the song to be legitimate on his Twitter.Spin described it as &quot;a country-tinged, mid-tempo lighter-raiser with lyrics about how &quot;you've got nothin' good to say / Keep your mouth shut.&quot;\n\nFrom March to April 2014, the band toured several places in South America, including Brazil and Portugal. For several shows, former bassist Duff McKagan rejoined the band to fill in for Stinson, who had previous commitments to touring with the Replacements.\n\nFrom May 21 to June 7, 2014, the band returned to Las Vegas for its second residency at The Joint titled No Trickery! An Evening of Destruction.&quot; After the Revolver Golden Gods Awards show in April 2014, Richard Fortus mentioned &quot;We are working on stuff and hopefully very soon we're going to have new stuff out. Well, in the next year.&quot; In an interview in June 2014, Rose commented on upcoming plans:\n\n    &quot;We recorded a lot of things before Chinese was out. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve worked more on some of those things and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve written a few new things. But basically, we have what I call kind of the second half of Chinese. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already recorded. And then we have a remix album made of the songs from Chinese. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been done for a while, too. But after Vegas, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to start looking very seriously at what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing in that regard.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn July 2014, Dizzy Reed mentioned the next album was 'close to being done', mentioning it was &quot;just a matter of picking out which songs will be on it&quot; and that the band had a &quot;shitload of songs, enough to make up another record or two&quot;. Richard Fortus stated about upcoming plans in February 2015, \n&quot;I don't think there's gonna be any touring soon. We have been working on material. And that sort of starts and stops, but we're still plugging away at it.&quot; Fortus then claimed in June 2015, &quot;WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to be doing stuff next year. \nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not going to have anything out this year. Next year it should be out and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be touring.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nNot to mention all the funny sounds that are being made by Rose,Slash and others about some kind of reunion but we wont mention that cause I waited from the 1991 Get used to the Illusion that we would git back G n R  and was not over impressed with what was given. Better than nothing yes But Slash did the work while we waited now we shall see or will I die of old age first","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b858bc7fe2327b833b7096e25fcb41ddcb3ed009","amp;dn":"Guns+N%27+Roses+-+Roses+N%27+Guns+2013+a4k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b858bc7fe2327b833b7096e25fcb41ddcb3ed009","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,88,188,127,226,50,123,131,59,112,150,226,95,203,65,221,203,62,208,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
