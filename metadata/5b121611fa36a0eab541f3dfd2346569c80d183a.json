Hyman VINE VOICE\nThis book describes the neuroscience behind decision making, and in particular the various parts of the brain that are involved in different parts of problem analysis. It is filled with interesting examples from real world situations such as airplane near-disasters, poker playing, and Parkinson's patients, and uses these examples to illustrate various parts of our brain machinery.\n\nThe book is an easy read, interesting, and informative. It is, however, a lightweight read. Do not expect great depth into any of the studies -- it is more like a survey course or cliff notes in many respects. This makes it approachable for an audience without any science background, but it also left me wanting a lot more depth. I also found the concluding chapter to be forced... it didn't really have much to offer.\n\nI am glad to have read the book, but I didn't walk away feeling amazed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b121611fa36a0eab541f3dfd2346569c80d183a","amp;dn":"How+We+Decide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b121611fa36a0eab541f3dfd2346569c80d183a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,18,22,17,250,54,160,234,181,65,243,223,210,52,101,105,200,13,24,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
