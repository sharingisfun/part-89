Berlin\nChamissoplatz uses meetings between tenants and city officials, and spin-off\nactivities from the housing issue, to provide ample venues for the two\nprotagonists (an older architect and a younger student) to fall in love. The\narchitect wants to demolish the buildings and redevelop the area, the student\nis fighting against demolition. The Chamissoplatz sector was one of the hot\nspots of the housing turmoil in the city, getting worse even as this film\nwas released. As street fights were breaking out in the real Berlin, the film\nhas its lovers escaping to Italy for a passionate interlude. The film is not\nexactly &quot;Walt Disney meets Watts,&quot; but the producers might have reconsidered\nthe timing of its release.
