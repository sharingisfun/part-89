It presents evaporation technology as it exists today. Although evaporation is one of the oldest unit operations, it is also an area with dramatic changes in the last quarter century. Although other methods of separation are available, evaporation remains the best process for many applications. All factors must be evaluated in order to select the best evaporator type. This book will be extremely useful in evaluating and deciding which evaporation technology will meet a particular set of requirements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a7f6bde3c05bb2afb8c86c4866d4396991a545","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Evaporation+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a7f6bde3c05bb2afb8c86c4866d4396991a545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,167,246,189,227,192,91,178,175,184,200,108,72,102,212,57,105,145,165,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
