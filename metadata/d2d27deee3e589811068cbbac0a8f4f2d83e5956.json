In a couple of evenings (or less) you can transform an out-of-the-box or kit-built model into something really special . . .\n\nOver the years Iain Rice has built, modified and generally upgraded many hundreds of wagons. In this DVD presentation he passes on the skills heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acquired in his usual accessible and highly entertaining fashion. He shows you how to enhance your wagon fleet by using whitemetal kits and readily available detailing components, how to modify your stock to reflect prototype variations and how to add realistic loads Ã¢â‚¬â€œ after all, carrying goods and minerals is what freight operations are all about. He talks in depth about painting and weathering and gives some useful hands-on advice about improving how your wagons run on your layout.\n\n\nImportant: Resolution = 768 x 576.
