Played by Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire's son and Francis Ford Coppola's nephew), Max is a poor student with big dreams and a love of extracurricular activities. \n\nMax is editor of the school newspaper and yearbook, president of the chess, astronomy, French, and German clubs, captain of the fencing team, and director of the school play. Max is also a compulsive liar, telling everyone that his barber father (Seymour Cassel) is really a brain surgeon. \n\nSuddenly Max falls in love with Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), a first-grade teacher at the school. He also makes a new friend in business tycoon Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire who also loves Miss Cross. \n\nThe love triangle heats up as Max refuses to believe that his age has anything to do with Miss Cross refusing his romantic advances. Also Max's scheme to erect an aquarium on the school baseball diamond gets him booted out of Rushmore Academy. \n\nAs his life crumbles around him, he is forced to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions and his lies. He throws himself more into his extracurricular activities, hoping to redeem himself by staging the most ambitious school play ever attempted.\n\n\n\nSTARS.........: Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams\nDIRECTOR......: Wes Anderson\nWRITERS.......: Wes Anderson, Owen Wilson\nGENRE.........: Comedy | Drama\nRATING........: 7.7/10  121,387 votes\nMETASCORE.....: 86/100\nIMDB LINK.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128445\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 33mn\nSIZE..........: 3.74 GiB\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;266e4f414e66120816&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x816\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (3-Pass)\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\nAUDIO.........: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\nSOURCE........: Rushmore.1998.1080p.Bluray.CC.AVC.Remux\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\nENCODE DATE...: 2015-04-27\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/6364/xY1luY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/6364/xY1luY.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/961/vPydbi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/961/vPydbi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/899/sokKQz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/899/sokKQz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/6331/2hXfdN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img540/6331/2hXfdN.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSample included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:728bf21da2df7893053835e5f2095896f7c52c7d","amp;dn":"Rushmore.1998.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"728bf21da2df7893053835e5f2095896f7c52c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,139,242,29,162,223,120,147,5,56,53,229,242,9,88,150,247,197,44,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
