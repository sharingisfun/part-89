It was co-produced by Michael Rother, their bandmate in Harmonia (whose two releases Zuckerzeit fell between). The music on Zuckerzeit is different from any other Cluster work and clearly shows Michael Rother's influence, with clearly defined melody and beat and a very rhythmic sound, at times approaching the Motorik style of Neu!. John Bush, writing the review for Allmusic, described Zuckerzeit as: &quot;...a vision of electronic pop, fusing the duo's haunted melodic sense with crisp, scratchy drum programs...&quot;\n\nAmong its fans are Brian Eno and Pitchfork Media, which ranked the album number 63 on their &quot;Top 100 Albums of The 1970s&quot;.[3] Eno was to later work with Harmonia on Tracks and Traces and the duo on the albums Cluster &amp; Eno and After the Heat. Julian Cope included Zuckerzeit in his Krautrock Top 50.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6104e55c0f095d704ab0478bb3f2b0fa1228da0","amp;dn":"Cluster+-+1974+-+Zuckerzeit+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6104e55c0f095d704ab0478bb3f2b0fa1228da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,16,78,85,192,240,149,215,4,171,4,120,187,63,43,15,161,34,141,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
