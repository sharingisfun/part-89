After a review of &quot;naÃƒÂ¯ve&quot; set theory, it develops the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of the theory before discussing the ordinal and cardinal numbers. It then delves into contemporary set theory, covering such topics as the Borel hierarchy and Lebesgue measure. A final chapter presents an alternative conception of set theory useful in computer science.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nHyperlinked ordered T.oC. so we can read it easily.\n  Wuv you all.  \n\n       \n\nhel  iia ruy    yu  raii     l e              h\n\nDo not litter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4add88d6f0208068e5987b84470281cb0a62000","amp;dn":"The+Joy+of+Sets+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4add88d6f0208068e5987b84470281cb0a62000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,173,216,141,111,2,8,6,142,89,135,184,68,112,40,28,176,166,32,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
