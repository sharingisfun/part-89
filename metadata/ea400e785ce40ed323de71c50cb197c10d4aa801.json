Tragic heroines, warriors, feisty servants, divas - the soprano sings some of the most fabulous roles in opera. But while the prima donna may suffer on stage, she doesn't suffer fools off it. The great sopranos have always been larger-than-life characters, adored by their public and, in the case of Maria Callas, famous far beyond the opera house, her private life of as much fascination to the press as her singing.\n\nBut how does the soprano carry off these vocally and dramatically demanding roles? How does the body work to produce the sound, and what techniques are at play? How do you make yourself heard up in the gods if you're competing with a huge orchestra? What is going on in a soprano's throat, indeed her whole body? How does she sing coloratura? What effect does vibrato have on us, the listeners?\n\nTo find out, Pappano looks in detail at performances from some of the legendary sopranos of the modern era - Maria Callas, Joan Sutherland, Birgit Nilsson, Leontyne Price, and Renata Tebaldi. And sharing their secrets are some of the leading sopranos of today - Anna Netrebko, Barbara Hannigan, Carolyn Sampson, Diana Damrau, and Eva-Maria Westbroek.\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/RvL0SAea3m.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/YL1UZnv4wb.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea400e785ce40ed323de71c50cb197c10d4aa801","amp;dn":"Pappanos.Classical.Voices.s01e01.Soprano.ENG.SUBS.WEBRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea400e785ce40ed323de71c50cb197c10d4aa801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,64,14,120,92,228,14,211,35,222,113,197,12,177,151,193,13,74,168,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
