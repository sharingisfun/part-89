Following the demise of an earlier, conspicuously synth pop-based outfit named Empire, the Hawkins brothers sowed the seeds of what would become the Darkness at an impromptu karaoke session on New Year's Eve 1999. Justin's rapturous rendition of Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; showed them the way, and the suitably dramatic name of the Darkness was chosen shortly after the arrival of Poullain and Graham. \n\n\nGenre................:Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Rhino\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Black Shuck\n02.Get Your Hands Off My Woman\n03.Growing On Me\n04.I Believe In A Thing Called Love\n05.Givin' Up\n06.Stuck In A Rut\n07.Love On The Rocks With No Ice\n08.One Way Ticket\n09.Knockers\n10.Is It Just Me?\n11.Hazel Eyes\n12.English Country Garden\n13.Nothin's Gonna Stop Us\n14.Keep Me Hangin' On\n15.Everybody Have A Good Time\n16.Barbarian\n17.Roaring Waters\n18.Mighty Wings\n19.Hammer &amp; Tongs\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1995536eda1cd730ab1704ed2ce383694d5cc80","amp;dn":"The+Darkness+-+Permission+To+Rock%21+The+Best+Of+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1995536eda1cd730ab1704ed2ce383694d5cc80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,153,85,54,237,161,205,115,10,177,112,78,210,206,56,54,148,213,204,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
