With only four couples remaining, Challenge One is mounting a new aluminum door on their cabins. Then their artistic side is allowed to shine: Challenge Two has the teams creating a sign for their cabins (it's not Group of Seven but hey, they're just handymen after all). Challenge Three speaks to their current state of mind Ã¢â‚¬â€ an exhaust fan. Tired as they are, the teams must properly hook up a fan to vent their kitchens. Now in the home stretch, the remaining four teams have hit their stride.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 25-May-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d22b1fec8fb84b6e428b987ad4b0647819aead37","amp;dn":"Blood.Sweat.and.Tools.S01E07.PDTV.x264-CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d22b1fec8fb84b6e428b987ad4b0647819aead37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,43,31,236,143,184,75,110,66,139,152,122,212,176,100,120,25,174,173,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
