Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n** updated DF to 0.40.09\n - removed Legends Exports Processor pending update to handle new legends export filenames\n - removed World Viewer, for the same reason\n - updated all graphics from Fricy's repository\n - added Jolly Bastion graphics\n - updated configuration files for soundsense and Announcement filter\n - removed dfhack; it'll be back when it updates for 40_09\n - disabled dfhack tab of the launcher until it stops throwing errors\n - updated Dwarf Therapist to 24.0; for DF 40_09\n - (sneaky change) fixed soundsense config, removed Jolly Bastion graphics\n\nMD5: 99387013B8843AFABF439CF188F5F398","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20028c7300e9897040ce5bc9d707e83d6a90313a","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_09+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20028c7300e9897040ce5bc9d707e83d6a90313a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,2,140,115,0,233,137,112,64,206,91,201,215,7,232,61,106,144,49,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
