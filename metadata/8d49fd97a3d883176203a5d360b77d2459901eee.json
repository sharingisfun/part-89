Their target: a bag of uncut sapphires worth millions. But when one of them stumbles across an enormous treasure that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t on the manifest, everything goes sideways. Within minutes two of them are dead, leaving the third, a coldblooded psychopath, to claim both the sapphires and the mysterious windfall for himself. If he disappears, he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just be wealthy. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the power to change the course of history.\n\nHis boss, Angela, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about to let that happen. She calls in a favor from her onetime protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©: a fixer sometimes known as Jack, or more often as simply the Ghostman. Within hours heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flying halfway around the world to find her in the glimmering neon slums of Macau. Jack has no real name, no address and no fingerprintsÃ¢â‚¬â€but given the right motivation, he can make serious problems vanish. Though the two havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talked since they botched a job six years ago, as soon as JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s off the plane theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re back together again, facing down a crime boss, a hit man and a conspiracy bigger than anything theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever encountered and more dangerous than they couldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve imagined.\n\nTheir partnershipÃ¢â‚¬â€between people with no lasting relationships whatsoeverÃ¢â‚¬â€is at the very heart of a novel that will cement Roger HobbsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s status as one of our most talented crime writers.\n \nNumber of pages: 304\n \nISBN13: 9780385352642\n \nISBN10: 0385352646\n \nFormat: EPUB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d49fd97a3d883176203a5d360b77d2459901eee","amp;dn":"Vanishing+Games+%28Jack+White+%232%29+by+Roger+Hobbs+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d49fd97a3d883176203a5d360b77d2459901eee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,73,253,151,163,216,131,23,98,3,165,211,96,183,125,36,89,144,30,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
