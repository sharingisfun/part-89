Touch to focus, pinch to zoom, swipe to review and long press for photo settings. The photo controller includes settings for colour, contrast and sharpness (if supported by the hardware). The additional settings menu gives you access to: Picture and Video Size, Scene mode, Self Timer, Burst Mode, Time Lapse, Still and Video Focus Modes, JPEG Quality, Effects, ISO and Anti-banding.\n\nThe powerful photo editor lets you add colour effects, borders, crop, rotate, mirror and straighten. You can also choose image effects, histogram modification and vignette. Undo an effect at any time from the history menu.\n\nShare an image with any other app such asor Google+ by clicking on the share icon.\n\nSnap works best on newer phones but will still run on older models.\n\nThe extra settings on the controller menu are only available on phones that support them. Most phones based on Qualcomm hardware do support these options but most others do not.\n\nCamera apps are notoriously difficult to make compatible with all hardware. If it doesn't work, please don't rate the app badly, let us know and we will try to fix it.\n\nPlease post bugs and suggestions on the XDA thread for this app by clicking on &quot;Visit Developer's Website&quot; below.\n\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Aug 26, 2015)\nNew translations\nSupport for Storage Framework on Lollipop\nRotation settings\nSmoother menu scrolling\nNexus 5 bugfixes\nDisplay video quality when recording\nFix disabling of menu button\nFix cropping crash on some devices\nFix panorama with camera2\nAllow grouping photos by size in the gallery\nFix initial focus on Nexus 5\nMaterial Design animations\nSwipe right to reveal settings menu\nRemember self timer value\nRequired Android O/S : 2.3.3+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97120bb78d3616d6977cf630eb91497c14b51563","amp;dn":"Snap+Camera+HDR+6.8.0+APK+%28Android%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97120bb78d3616d6977cf630eb91497c14b51563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,18,11,183,141,54,22,214,151,124,246,48,235,145,73,124,20,181,21,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
