In seeking to give the residents of poor communities, who have traditionally been excluded from the world of gallery art, a greater role in shaping their built environment, the artists' aesthetic practice itself was significantly transformed. In their thirty-five year history the Free Form Arts Trust played a major role in the struggle to establish community arts in Great Britain and Community Art gives their story worldwide relevance. It examines how this experiment reimagined the place of the artist in the making of art and challenges common understandings of the categories of &quot;art&quot;, &quot;expertise&quot;, and &quot;community&quot; as well as the place of the individualized practice of the gallery artist.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s1.postimg.org/4abzn1uin/catek.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s1.postimg.org/4abzn1uin/catek.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nKate Crehan is Professor of Anthropology, College of Staten Island and Graduate Center, City University of New York. \nDegree: PhD U Manchester 1986\nResearch Interests: Gramsci, political economy, gender, development, public anthropology, aesthetics; Southern Africa\nSubfield: Cultural Anthropology\n\nCONTENTS\nList of Figures vii\nAcknowledgements xi\nPreface xiii\nI: The Rejection\n1 Art Inside and Outside the Gallery 3\nII: The Shaping\n2 Moving beyond the Gallery 29\n3 From Performance to the Environment 57\n4 Community Arts and the Democratization of Expertise 79\n5 Responding to Local Needs: Goldsmiths 95\n6 Making Art Collaboratively: Provost 111\n7 Theoretical and Political Locations 129\nIII: Into the Twenty-first Century\n8 Free Form in 2004 141\n9 A Carnival and a Standing Stone 157\nConclusion: Of Art and Community 181\nReferences 197\nIndex 203\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s13.postimg.org/dbee2ruw7/Community_Art_An_Anthropological_Perspective.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s13.postimg.org/dbee2ruw7/Community_Art_An_Anthropological_Perspective.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44f6abd9735cb0297d6849327bd7c80d46483f65","amp;dn":"Community+Art+-+An+Anthropological+Perspective+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44f6abd9735cb0297d6849327bd7c80d46483f65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,246,171,217,115,92,176,41,125,104,73,50,123,215,200,13,70,72,63,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
