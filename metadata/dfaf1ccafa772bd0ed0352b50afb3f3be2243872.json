The sound is superb and has been recorded and\nmastered by Jon Rosenberg. The first disc is appropriately called\n&quot;Improvisations 1&quot; and the duo wind their way into a long journey-like set of\nstories. At first Mr. Braxton is playing a sopranino sax sublimely while\nMs. Yakshieva plays elegant, dream-like piano. Braxton then switches to alto\nwhile Maral plays an exquisite solo passage. Mr. Braxton seems more reflective\nthan usual, his tone, the warmest and most enchanting in recent memory. The\ntempo and the tension increases as the duo take off with more flurries of\nnotes, intertwining marvelously in tight spirals. This entire disc has a most\nrelaxed vibe as if both of the musicians have been playing together for many\nyears and feel completely comfortable. About halfway through the first disc,\nBraxton plays this cool melody which Ms. Yakshieva picks up on and the duo\nweave their ideas around that melody for a bit anticipating each other's\nlines. Each of these two discs is over 50 minutes long and each disc is filled\nwith some magnificent, magical improvising. Yet another treasure from the vast\nBraxton catalogue of wonders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfaf1ccafa772bd0ed0352b50afb3f3be2243872","amp;dn":"Anthony+Braxton%2C+Maral+Yakshieva+-+Improvisations+%28Duo%29+2008+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfaf1ccafa772bd0ed0352b50afb3f3be2243872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,175,28,202,250,119,43,208,237,3,82,181,10,251,63,59,226,36,56,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
