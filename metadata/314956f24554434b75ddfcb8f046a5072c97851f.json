In 1962, he formed\na group that became The Paramounts, later including Westcliff High School pupil Gary Brooker.\nThe Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual projects. During this time, Trower\ncreated a local three-piece band called the Jam [not to be confused with the later group with\nPaul Weller]. Trower then joined Brooker's new band Procol Harum following the success of their\ndebut single &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; in 1967, remaining with them until 1971 and appearing on\nProcol Harum's first five albums\n\n\nJohn Symon Asher &quot;Jack&quot; Bruce [14 May 1943 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 25 October 2014] was a Scottish musician, composer\nand vocalist, known primarily for his multi-faceted contributions to the legendary British\nsupergroup Cream, which included guitarist-singer Eric Clapton and drummer-founder Ginger Baker.\nIn March, 2011, Rolling Stone readers selected him as the eighth greatest bass guitarist of all\ntime. &quot;Most musicians would have a very hard time distinguishing themselves if they wound up in\na band with Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker,&quot; the magazine said at the time, &quot;but Jack Bruce was\nso gifted on the bass that he did it with ease.&quot;\n\nBruce maintained a solo career that spanned several decades and also played in several musical\ngroups. Although recognized first and foremost as a vocalist, bassist and songwriter, he also\nplayed double bass, harmonica, piano and cello. He was trained as a classical cellist and\nconsidered himself a jazz musician, although much of his catalogue of compositions and recordings\ntended toward blues and rock and roll.\n\nTrack List\n\n\nJack Bruce &amp; Robin Trower - Truce [2012 Remastered Versions]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/59530638190675699128.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/59530638190675699128.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01.
