It provides an overall picture of the architecture of Akrotiri, including an outline of its town plan, a description of the individual houses, and a discussion of its relationship with Crete and its neighbours in the Eastern Mediterranean. The book is based on the author's personal observations and experience obtained over a fifteen year period (1977-1992) of work at the site of the Akrotiri excavation. This book is confined to the last phase of habitation and the uniquely preserved houses that are seen today","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9fe6dd1bd4f5cea0a1f59111ad996c58b849d3","amp;dn":"Akrotiri+Thera-An+Architecture+of+Affluence+3500+Years+Old","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9fe6dd1bd4f5cea0a1f59111ad996c58b849d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,159,230,221,27,212,245,206,160,161,245,145,17,173,153,108,88,184,73,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
