It was Cluster's first release for Krautrock label Sky Records, a relationship which would last until 1983 including albums with Brian Eno, solo recordings, and three albums by the duo of Moebius and former Cluster member and frequent engineer/producer Conny Plank.\n\nSowiesoso was Cluster's gentlest and most melodic album of electronic music to that point. Brian Eno had worked with Moebius and Roedelius with Harmonia prior to the recording of Sowiesoso and worked with Cluster again on two albums in 1977 and 1978 and the influence of the British ambient musician is clearly heard on the softer and more controlled sound of this album. Russ Curry describes the album this way: &quot;...a fully realized marriage of electronic sounds with a pastoral warmth.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1b652dfdd7c0eb1d99afc2187e53a60e60cefa8","amp;dn":"Cluster+-+1976+-+Sowiesoso+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1b652dfdd7c0eb1d99afc2187e53a60e60cefa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,182,82,223,221,124,14,177,217,154,252,33,135,229,58,96,230,12,239,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
