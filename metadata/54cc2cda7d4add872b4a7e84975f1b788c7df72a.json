Ripped from the limited edition 7&quot; LP.\n\n\nA very limited release from Warlord, the 7&quot; vinyl &quot;Live At Keep It True XVI&quot;, first available as a bonus on &quot;The Imperial Box&quot; (limited to 150 copies) released in late 2014, and then another run of this 7&quot; alone released in early 2015, which was another 100 copies. This is recorded straight from the LP, and balanced for proper sound. It's the best (if not only) copy you'll find out there.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. Child Of The Damned\n2.
