Back At The Lab (2015)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nSlightly Stoopid's Miles Doughty and Kyle McDonald were signed to Sublime mastermind Brad Nowell's Skunk imprint while still in high school, and did two albums for the label, Slightly Stoopid in 1996 and Longest Barrel Ride two years later. While the sound back then was SoCal skatepunk influenced by thrash elements and copious amounts of weed, Doughty and McDonald's playing and singing had matured considerably by 2001 and Live &amp; Direct: Acoustic Roots. The duo was later rounded by drummer Ryan Moran and percussionist/vocalist Oguer Ocon. By 2003 and Everything You Need, they were rocking a California-centric sound of loopy sampledelic pop, hip-hop influence, sunny marijuana affirmations, and the occasional return to raucous skatepunk.\n\n\nGenre................: Alternative\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Stoopid Records\nIncluded.............: Front Cover &amp; auCDtect\n\n\n\n01.Dabbington\n02.This Version\n03.The Prophet\n04.Hold It Down\n05.Fades Away\n06.Fuck You (Feat.
