It comes with a whole host of programs, features, and services that, best case, take up unnecessary space, or worst case, slow down your machine. If you'd rather have a slimmer installation of Windows, you can create your own Windows installer with RT Se7en LiteÃ¢â‚¬â€complete with tons of other customizations so you can turn Windows into your dream OS. Here's how to do it.\n\nRT Se7en Lite (yes, the name is insane) is a configuration tool that lets you edit your Windows install disc. You can remove Windows features you don't want, add drivers you know you'll need, add or remove items from the Control Panel and right-click menu, and lots more. You can even create a disc that includes Service Pack 1 (through a process called &quot;slipstreaming&quot;) so you don't have to sit through hours of Windows updates every time you install Windows on a new machine. The tool is remarkably easy to use, and even with heavy tweaking, it does a good job of making sure you don't remove anything that's going to screw up your system.\n\nWhat You'll Get\n\nThe process may seem a tad long and arduous, but the final product is well worth the work. You can use RT Se7en Lite to customize Windows 7 in a ton of ways. For example, you could:\n\nCut your install time in half by slipstreaming Service Pack 1 and adding all your favorite apps to your install disc, so you don't have to sit there installing things each time you put Windows on a new computer.\nCreate a minimalist version of Windows, which cuts out all the unnecessary apps and services and makes your computer run fasterÃ¢â‚¬â€perfect for old or low-powered hardware.\nSave space by removing apps and services you don't need, not to mention remove the things that annoy you (like those annoying games or the &quot;Welcome to Windows&quot; app you really don't need).\nMake all your favorite system tweaks and registry hacks before you install Windows, so you don't have to make them later onÃ¢â‚¬â€a clean installation of Windows becomes your perfect installation of Windows.\nAdd drivers to your install disc so you don't have to go rummaging for them later on. This is especially great for ethernet and wi-fi drivers, which would require you to find and insert your manufacturer's disc to install them (since, if you don't have ethernet or wi-fi drivers, you paradoxically can't access the internet to download their drivers).\nWhen you're done with RT Se7en Lite, you'll have your own, custom Windows disc containing all your favorite settings, speed-boosting tweaks, and favorite apps, ready to install on any machineÃ¢â‚¬â€essentially, you'll have the Windows you always wished you had. It's especially great if you install Windows on multiple machines, or reinstall it regularly. You only have to make these tweaks once, and they'll be added every time you do a fresh install.
