Ry Cooder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœSan PatricioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2010) is in equal measure a curio, a lament, a history lesson and a hoedown, Ã¢â‚¬ËœSan PatricioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is one of those albums that happily transcends its parts. The Californian guitarist and the Irish folk heavyweights are seasoned collaborators as well as inveterate globetrotters. Bumping cheeky mariachis up against Celtic ballads, the stellar cast includes Linda Ronstadt, legendary arranger Van Dyke Parks, the sensational Mexican singer Lila Downs, Moya Brennan from Clannad, and battalions of crack instrumentalists. \nThis is a transatlantic musical campaign whose virtuosity, verve and sheer eccentric heart make it hard to resist.\n\n\nCD 2: The Chieftains Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœVoice of AgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2012) is another stellar collaboration between the Irish band and many top musicians, marking The Chieftains 50th anniversary.  On Ã¢â‚¬ËœVoice Of AgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ The Chieftains team up with a number of musical stars from the worlds of indie-rock (Bon Iver, The Decemberists, The Low Anthem), country and Americana (The Civil Wars, Pistol Annies, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Punch Brothers), Irish folk (Imelda May, Lisa Hannigan) and Scottish folk (Paolo Nutini)  whose music is not quite far removed from Irish jigs, reels and ballads.  \nAn imaginative collaboration featuring a dazzling collection of like-minded musical visionaries and kindred spirits\n\n\n\nThe Chieftains\n\nCD 1: The Chieftains feat.
