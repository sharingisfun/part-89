In 1970, the band began to rein in their experimental tendencies and overtly acknowledge their debt to old-time blues and folk. Their two studio albums from that year reflected this new direction and they also started to open their shows with acoustic sets featuring Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir. This May 2 show from Binghamton, New York's Harpur College showcases both sides of the Dead. It's interesting how nicely acoustic Dead originals like &quot;Dire Wolf,&quot; &quot;Black Peter,&quot; &quot;Cumberland Blues,&quot; and &quot;Uncle John's Band&quot; (all four from the soon-to-be-released Workingman's Dead) fit next to traditional blues tunes like &quot;Deep Elem Blues,&quot; &quot;I Know You Rider,&quot; and &quot;Don't Ease Me In.&quot; The remainder of the set reverts to the frenetic, far-reaching electric Dead, highlighted by stirring readings of James Brown's &quot;It's a Man's World&quot; and the old jug tune &quot;Viola Lee Blues&quot;--both stretched to their gills and featuring Pigpen's coarse vocals and Garcia's bold guitar work.\n\nRipped with Rubyripper 0.6.2 on Ubuntu 14.04\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed please!\n\njoh73 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee8c6b6afd06a600428edb80786e1f5cb87bf42","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+%281970%29+Dicks+Picks+Volume+8+5270+Harpur+College+Bi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee8c6b6afd06a600428edb80786e1f5cb87bf42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,232,198,182,175,208,106,96,4,40,237,184,7,134,225,245,203,135,191,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
