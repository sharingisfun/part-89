In Challenge One the teams must mount a water heater, a task that requires both plumbing and electrical skills. Challenge Two has them building a cocktail bar and cutting a custom copper top for its surface. But just when they think it's cocktail hour, a plot twist: there's another elimination and just three teams remain. The final three couples must then complete Challenge Three, a project of their own choosing to impress Canada. Viewers are reminded that at the end of this episode, they can begin casting their votes! And that in the next and final episode, the winner of the $50,000 grand prize will be announced!\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 01-Jun-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d700a46daac8f48fac5f60e4bfba2994caab228c","amp;dn":"Blood.Sweat.and.Tools.S01E08.PDTV.x264-CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d700a46daac8f48fac5f60e4bfba2994caab228c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,0,164,109,170,200,244,143,172,95,96,228,191,186,41,148,202,171,34,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
