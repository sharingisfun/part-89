These proceedings represent an excellent and up-to-date overview of recent advances in this important area, providing much information and facts that are not available elsewhere.\nThe result is a collection of top quality contributions by experienced editors and international authors on such fields as separation and fractionation, high throughput processes, thermal and crystallinity analysis, spectroscopy and rheology.\nEqually of high interest for the polymer industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa421cf5442222b44a0a6ea6519e4dea9b4a9c41","amp;dn":"Polyolefin+Characterization+%28Macromolecular+Symposia+257%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa421cf5442222b44a0a6ea6519e4dea9b4a9c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,66,28,245,68,34,34,180,74,10,110,166,81,158,77,234,155,74,156,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
