As previously noted, while there are a number of excellent\nbooks covering plant design, process engineering and cement chemistry,\nthere is little of a general or introductory nature addressing cement\nmanufacturing operations. New to this edition is a chapter covering\ncombustion and heat transfer - technology that has long been neglected\nby the cement industry.\nAgain for brevity, the objective has been constrained, and whole areas\nof operations technology and management have been omitted as being\ninappropriate to address in so limited a compass. It is also appreciated\nthat regulations, specifications and even operating practices are not universal,\nand our observations should be discounted accordingly.\nThe scope attempted comprehends:\nA consideration only of cyclone preheater kiln technology which\ncomprises more than 80% of world production and virtually all\nkilns installed since 1970.\nThe use only of metric units.\nA review of major plant sub-systems with a proposed list of data\nwhich should be available to plant and corporate management.\nand some suggestions regarding problem areas and possible\nsolutions.\nA summary of cement types and concrete problems.\nReference to ASTM specifications for cements and for\nstandard methods.\nA collection of process formulae.\nA selection of reference data and notes.\nAn outline of plant assessment and plant valuation.\nReferences to review articles and a limited bibliography.\nAddresses of pertinent organisations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5da8a12abe79cd21efcce61749479f78c3c5f3f","amp;dn":"The+Cement+Plant+Operation+Handbook+3rd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5da8a12abe79cd21efcce61749479f78c3c5f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,218,138,18,171,231,156,210,30,252,206,97,116,148,121,247,140,60,95,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
