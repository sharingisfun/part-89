It premiered on BBC One on 17 May 2015.\n \n \nSet in England during the Napoleonic wars at the beginning of the 19th century, the series presents an alternate history where magic is widely acknowledged, but rarely practiced. Living in the rural north, Mr Norrell (Eddie Marsan) of Hurtfew Abbey is able to make the statues of York Minster talk and move. His manservant John Childermass (Enzo Cilenti) persuades him to travel to London to help in the war against France. While there, Mr Norrell encounters a leading member of the government and makes magic respectable in the realm when he conjures a fairy to bring the minister's fiancÃƒÂ©e (Alice Englert) back to life. Meanwhile, Jonathan Strange (Bertie Carvel) meets Vinculus (Paul Kaye), a street magician, while attempting to find a respectable profession, as demanded by his love Arabella (Charlotte Riley). Strange is told by Vinculus that he is destined to be a great magician and so he begins to study magic\n \n \n \n \n\n1/7 Mr Norrell makes a dangerous pact. Jonathan Strange learns he too has magical gifts.\n\n2/7 Mr Norrell takes Jonathan Strange as his apprentice in the ways of magic. \n\n3/7 Jonathan Strange accesses ancient and troubling magic as he fights the Napoleonic armies. \n\n4/7 Norrell's refusal to let Strange study ancient magic causes a split between them.\n\n5/7 The Gentleman's scheme for revenge wrecks all of Strange and Arabella's plans.\n\n6/7 Strange attempts to drive himself insane as a way of gaining access to fairy magic.\n\n7/7 Strange comes back home to claim Mr Norrell and rescue Arabella. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02mrqzv&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02mrqzv&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n\n \nJonathan Strange And Mr. Norrell - S01 - (7x60 Minutes)\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Jonathan Strange And Mr. Norrell.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 3s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 657 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : No\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 3s\nBitrate                     : 1 405 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.188\nStream size                 : 594 MB (85%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 3s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 239 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 101 MB (14%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 472 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 19.7 --abr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5cf600981e5921ac707042cafe8dc3a0f2a217f","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Strange+And+Mr.+Norrell+-+S01+-+Drama+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5cf600981e5921ac707042cafe8dc3a0f2a217f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,207,96,9,129,229,146,26,199,7,4,44,175,232,220,58,15,42,33,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
