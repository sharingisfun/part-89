Adaptive control problems are newly proposed and solved for dynamical systems which satisfy the time-invariant condition. The monograph provides new results and their extensions which can also be more applicable for nonlinear dynamical systems. A new method which produces manipulated inputs is presented in the sense of state control and output control. To present the effectiveness of the method, many numerical examples of control problems are provided as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7cbdce10eb572a5bbfc22ee16ec859268406667","amp;dn":"Control+Problems+of+Discrete-Time+Dynamical+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7cbdce10eb572a5bbfc22ee16ec859268406667","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,203,220,225,14,181,114,165,187,252,34,238,22,236,133,146,104,64,102,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
