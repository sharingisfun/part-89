Since 1948, Advances in Catalysis has filled the gap between the papers that report on and the textbooks that teach in the diverse areas of catalysis research. The editors of and contributors to Advances in Catalysis are dedicated to recording progress in this area. \n\n* Provides a comprehensive review of all aspects of catalytic research \n* Contains in-depth, critical, state-of-the-art reports","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcc5361d90d85a1a9d955bc1a19b3f1a45bf26f6","amp;dn":"ADVANCES+IN+CATALYSIS+VOLUME+53","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcc5361d90d85a1a9d955bc1a19b3f1a45bf26f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,197,54,29,144,216,90,26,157,149,91,193,161,155,63,26,69,191,38,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
