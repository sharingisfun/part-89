But the erosion of privacy rights extends far beyond big government. Intelligence agencies such as the NSA and CIA are using Silicon Valley corporate partners as their data spies. Seemingly progressive tech companies are joining forces with snooping government agencies to create a brave new world of wired tyranny.\n\nLife in the digital age poses an unprecedented challenge to our constitutional liberties, which guarantee a wall of privacy between the individual and the government. The basic assumption of democracy requires the ability of the individual to experiment with ideas and associations within a protected zone, as secured by the Constitution. The unobserved moment embodies the most basic of human rights, yet it is being squandered in the name of national security and consumer convenience.\n\nRobert Scheer argues that the information revolution, while a source of public enlightenment, contains the seeds of freedomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s destruction in the form of a surveillance state that exceeds the wildest dream of the most ingenious dictator. The technology of surveillance, unless vigorously resisted, represents an existential threat to the liberation of the human spirit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:929dc1607c29d014ebbe8667d66c239ce4bab5e8","amp;dn":"Robert+Scheer+-+They+Know+Everything+About+You+%282015%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"929dc1607c29d014ebbe8667d66c239ce4bab5e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,157,193,96,124,41,208,20,235,190,134,103,214,108,35,156,228,186,181,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
