The film was directed by Roger Young for Warner Bros. Television with Richard Chamberlain in the title role, along with Jaclyn Smith. It follows the storyline of the original novel, with a run-time of 3 hours 5 min. With commercials added, the running time was extended to four hours. The film was first shown on ABC in two two-hour installments over two nights. The film was the last TV film for both Anthony Quayle and Denholm Elliott.\n\nPlot: An unconscious man is washed ashore on the beach of a small French village during a heavy storm. A retired doctor takes care of the unconscious stranger. When the mysterious man recovers, he can't remember a thing...he does not know his name, he does not know where his flashback memories come from, and he does not know why the access code for an anonymous Swiss bank account is implanted in his thigh. As he seeks his own identity, things quickly become dangerous. There are attempts to kill him, he is well known in first class hotels across Europe, and worst of all, there are strange similarities between his memories and reported actions of the notorious terrorist, Carlos the Jackal.\n\nA/V INFO\n--------\nLength: 181 min.\nAvg. bitrate: 1142kb/s\nVideo: XVid, 720x400px, 25fps\nAudio: mp3, 2.0, 48000Hz, stereo\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Film!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff85f3cdceac0219c5af80ee61a1c47a57e7b735","amp;dn":"The_Bourne_Identity%5B1988%5DDVDRip-EngAudio%5Bmp3%5D-NLSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff85f3cdceac0219c5af80ee61a1c47a57e7b735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,133,243,205,206,172,2,25,197,175,128,238,97,161,196,122,87,231,183,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
