Runner\nSuper Off Road (including its upgrade/add-on pack, Super Off Road Track Pack)\nHydro Thunder (console version)\nSan Francisco Rush 2049 (console version)\n\nWhile most of the games in this collection are emulations or recreations of the arcade versions, Hydro Thunder and Rush 2049 are based on the console versions, specifically ports of the Dreamcast releases. Additionally, San Francisco Rush: The Rock was re-programmed from the ground up; while the tracks and vehicles are the same as the arcade version, the physics engine is slightly different, and the music has been replaced, save for the &quot;What's Your Name?&quot; high score music. However, this version runs at 60 frames per second, which is faster than the arcade.\n\n\nCovers included\nJust burn it or put in your hdd/sd in order to play on Wii/vWii (WiiU)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4383aef5e2774864c685671abb2a81af781758ed","amp;dn":"Midway+ArcadeTreasures+3+%5BNGC%5D+USA+STINKYCUBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4383aef5e2774864c685671abb2a81af781758ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,131,174,245,226,119,72,100,198,133,103,26,187,42,129,175,120,23,88,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
