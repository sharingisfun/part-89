Set in southern Los Angeles (which makes for a terrifying sequence as blind Rachel and ailing Lars are trapped in their home without power during the 1992 Rodney King riots), backgrounds and props are lovingly detailed: these objects serve as memory triggers for Lars and Rachel, even as they eventually overwhelm them and their home, which the couple is loathe to leave. Special Exits is laid out in an eight-panel grid, which creates a leisurely storytelling pace that not only helps to convey the slow, inexorable decline in LarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and RachelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health, but perfectly captures the timbre of the exchanges between a long-married couple: the affectionate bickering; their gallows humor; their querulousness as their bodies break down.\n\nThough Lars and Rachel are the protagonists of Special Exits, Farmer makes her voice known through creative visual metaphors and in her indictment of the careless treatment of the elderly in nursing homes. Special Exits gracefully deals with the hard reality of caring for aging loved ones: those who are or who have been in similar situations might find comfort in it, and those who havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t will find much to admire in the bravery and good humor of Lars and Rachel.\n\nJoyce Farmer, best known for co-creating the Tits Ã¢â‚¬â„¢n Clits comics anthology in the 1970s, a feminist response to the rampant misogyny in underground comix, spent 11 years crafting Special Exits, a graphic memoir in the vein of Alison BechdelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fun Home or Harvey Pekar, Joyce Brabner, and Frank StackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Our Cancer Year, about caring for her dying father and stepmother.\n\nThe cover blurb by some guy named Robert Crumb (heh) says, &quot;One of the best long-narrative comics I've ever read, right up there with Maus... I actually found myself moved to tears.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51da3ba0c36faaa9c4f46bff31d781dc4ebdf283","amp;dn":"Joyce+Farmer+-+Special+Exits+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51da3ba0c36faaa9c4f46bff31d781dc4ebdf283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,218,59,160,195,111,170,169,196,244,107,255,49,215,129,220,78,189,242,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
