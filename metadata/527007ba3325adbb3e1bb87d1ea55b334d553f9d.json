No-one wants this more than Ash, but he's equally determined to stop more lethal pills from hitting the streets.\n\nAs Roach waits to hear news of his foray into the pill business, he's unaware of the net closing around him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:527007ba3325adbb3e1bb87d1ea55b334d553f9d","amp;dn":"The.Interceptor.s01e05.ENG.SUBS.WEBRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"527007ba3325adbb3e1bb87d1ea55b334d553f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,112,7,186,51,37,173,187,62,27,184,125,30,165,91,51,77,85,63,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
