Harmonia was formed by the addition of Neu! guitarist Michael Rother to Cluster, the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius. British ambient musician Brian Eno joined the group at Harmonia's studio in Forst, Germany for the September 1976 recording sessions which resulted in this album.\n\nAlthough Tracks and Traces was recorded in 1976, it was not released until 4 November 1997 by the American Rykodisc label (originally in Germany by the label S3, remastered by Eric Spitzer-Marlyn and Othmar Eichinger),[1] at which time the labels appended &quot;'76&quot; to the group's name.\n\nJeff Melton, who reviewed Tracks and Traces for the Expose Progressive Music website, described the album, in part: &quot;Overall the album is relaxing and evokes dream like images but doesn't force you to passively count sheep. For a lost project which had been unreleased for over twenty years, I'd say it's as current [as] any techno project if only for the strength of the collaboration and the blurring of egos.&quot; The album has only one vocal track, &quot;Luneburg Heath&quot;. Jess Barnett, writing in her review for FensePost, comments that the song &quot;has a strong Eno presence and a disembodied voice singing, 'DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get lost on Luneberg Heath'. The synth lines are twangy and muffled, repetitive but not boring.&quot; Ned Raggett, writing the review for Allmusic, says in part: &quot;Having already created two excellent albums, the core Harmonia trio was easily placed to whip up a third, with Eno the wild-card factor who turned out to be a perfect addition. While contributing some lyrics and singing at a time when he was steering away firmly from both in his own solo work, most of the time Eno lets the band speak for themselves musically, most notably adding snaky, quietly threatening basslines.&quot;\n\nHarmonia &amp; Eno '76 - 2009 reissue[edit]\nTracks and Traces was remastered and reissued in 2009 by GrÃƒÂ¶nland Records. The new release featured three additional recordings, new artwork and was credited to Harmonia &amp; Eno '76. A 12&quot; of remixes was also released, coupling &quot;Sometimes In Autumn&quot; and &quot;By The Riverside&quot; re-fixed by Dubstep-producers Shackleton and Appleblim/Komonazmuk. In 2009 a full album of remixes was released","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d096cd32a85795177d60744b3316a13ee62c2307","amp;dn":"Harmonia+%26amp%3B+Eno+76+-+Tracks+and+Traces+%282009+Reissue%29+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d096cd32a85795177d60744b3316a13ee62c2307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,150,205,50,168,87,149,23,125,96,116,75,51,22,161,62,230,44,35,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
