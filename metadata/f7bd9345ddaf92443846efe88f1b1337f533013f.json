However, most introductory books on this enormous and important field do not stress practical problem solving or include recent advances, which are critical for the modern polymer scientist-to-be. Updating the popular first edition of &quot;the polymer book for the new millennium,&quot; Introduction to Polymer Science and Chemistry: A Problem-Solving Approach, Second Edition seamlessly integrates exploration of the fundamentals of polymer science and polymer chemistry.\n\nSee WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in the Second Edition:\n\n* Chapter on living/controlled radical polymerization, using a unique problem-solving approach\n\n* Chapter on polymer synthesis by &quot;click&quot; chemistry, using a unique problem-solving approach\n\n* Relevant and practical work-out problems and case studies\n\n* Examples of novel methods of synthesis of complex polymer molecules by exciting new techniques\n\n* Figures and schematics of the novel synthetic pathways described in the new examples\n\nAuthor Manas Chanda takes an innovative problem-solving approach in which the text presents worked-out problems or questions with answers at every step of the development of a new theory or concept, ensuring a better grasp of the subject and scope for self study. Containing 286 text-embedded solved problems and 277 end-of-chapter home-study problems (fully answered separately in a Solutions Manual), the book provides a comprehensive understanding of the subject. These features and more set this book apart from other currently available polymer chemistry texts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7bd9345ddaf92443846efe88f1b1337f533013f","amp;dn":"Introduction+To+Polymer+Science+and+Chemistry+-+Manas+Chanda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7bd9345ddaf92443846efe88f1b1337f533013f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,189,147,69,221,175,146,68,56,70,239,232,143,27,19,55,245,51,1,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
