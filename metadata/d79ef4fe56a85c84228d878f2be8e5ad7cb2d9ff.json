It was released on September 4, 2007. It was recorded at DRS Studios in Waco, Texas. Sales figures, however, have been low, with the album only selling 3,600 copies in its first week, landing it at #186 on the Billboard 200. The pre-release cover art drew some controversy, as it depicts a naked woman bound and with a grenade in her mouth, on her knees on a platter.\n\nHe remakes the acid-rock hit &quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot;, made popular by his '60s group The Amboy Dukes.\n\nTed Nugent\n\nLove Grenade\n\n2007 \n \nCD\n\n&quot;Love Grenade&quot; - 5:03\n&quot;Still Raising Hell&quot; - 3:21\n&quot;Funk U&quot; - 4:00\n&quot;Girl Scout Cookies&quot; - 4:03\n&quot;Journey to the Center of the Mind&quot; - 4:21\n&quot;Geronimo &amp; Me&quot; - 4:44\n&quot;EagleBrother&quot; (Instrumental) - 4:38\n&quot;Spirit of the Buffalo&quot; - 7:29\n&quot;Aborigine&quot; - 3:22\n&quot;Stand&quot; - 2:43\n&quot;Broadside&quot; - 3:36\n&quot;Bridge over Troubled Daughters&quot; - 3:36\n&quot;Lay with Me&quot; - 6:23\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79ef4fe56a85c84228d878f2be8e5ad7cb2d9ff","amp;dn":"Ted+Nugent+-+Love+Grenade+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79ef4fe56a85c84228d878f2be8e5ad7cb2d9ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,158,244,254,86,168,92,132,34,141,135,143,43,232,229,173,124,178,217,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
