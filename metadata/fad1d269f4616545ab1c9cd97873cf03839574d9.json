Beginning with an overview of municipal solid waste production and disposal, basic concepts related to Waste-To-Energy conversion processes are described, highlighting the most relevant aspects impacting the thermodynamic efficiency of WTE power plants. The pervasive influences of main steam cycle parameters and plant configurations on WTE efficiency are detailed and quantified. Advanced hybrid technology applications, particularly the Hybrid Combined Cycle concept, are examined in detail, including an illuminating compare-and-contrast study of two basic types of hybrid dual-fuel combined cycle arrangements: steam/water side integrated HCC and windbox repowering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad1d269f4616545ab1c9cd97873cf03839574d9","amp;dn":"Waste-to-Energy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad1d269f4616545ab1c9cd97873cf03839574d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,209,210,105,244,97,101,69,171,28,156,217,120,115,207,3,131,149,116,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
