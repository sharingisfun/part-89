Authors Dave Mark, Jayant Varma, Jeff LaMarche, Alex Horovitz, and Kevin Kim explain concepts as only they canÃ¢â‚¬â€with code snippets you can customize and use, as you like, in your own apps.\n\n\nMore iPhone Development with Objective-C is an independent companion to Beginning iPhone Development with Objective-C. That is, it is a perfect second book, but it is also a great book for those looking to improve their skills who have already programmed for iOS. In particular it includes a series of chapters devoted to Core Data, the standard for Apple persistence. The authors carefully step through each Core Data concept and show techniques and tips specifically for writing larger appsÃ¢â‚¬â€offering a breadth of coverage you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find anywhere else.\n\nMore iPhone Development with Objective-C covers a variety of other topics, including Multipeer ConnectivityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relatively simple Bluetooth/WiFi peer-to-peer model, MapKit, and media library access and playback so that your applications can utilize media on your usersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ computer. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find coverage of Interface Builder, Live Previews and Custom Controls and some advanced techniques for debugging your applications. The book is filled with useful topics that will bring your programs up-to-date with the new functionality built into iOS.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\nHow to embed maps with Map Kit and use in-application email\nHow to access a userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iPod music library and integrate music into apps\nWorking with data from the web and the cloud, including AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iCloud\nUsing the Camera to integrate into your apps, scan and create barcodes\nLive previews from Interface Builder to create custom components and frameworks\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book serves as a complementary book to More iOS 6 Development: Further Explorations of the iOS SDK and is suitable for those aspiring app developers new to iPad app development. Prior Objective-C programming experience would be helpful, but not required","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b86fcd177e47d23d43c913f0e344920ce7fef263","amp;dn":"More+iPhone+Development+with+Objective-C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b86fcd177e47d23d43c913f0e344920ce7fef263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,111,205,23,126,71,210,61,67,201,19,240,227,68,146,12,231,254,242,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
