Juliet is surprised to learn from Miss Vicki that Fitzwilly graduated with honors from Williams College, and she opines that he should be doing something more &quot;worthy&quot; than being a butler, like joining the Peace Corps.\n\nAfter Juliet inadvertently and unknowingly foils several minor operations, Fitzwilly becomes determined to get rid of her. He conceives a plan to court her in order to induce her to quit. Unexpectedly, the two fall in love. Still unaware of Fitzwilly's secret life, Juliet does quit when Fitzwilly refuses to discuss ending his life in service.\n\nThen Juliet stumbles upon evidence of Fitzwilly's past crimes, and returns to the mansion to confront him. Fitzwilly proposes marriage and agrees to end the criminal operations and tell Miss Vicki everything, but there is a problem: due to Juliet's past interference, the household is $75,000 'short', and they have to raise the money by Christmas Day. This leads to a complex setpiece in which the Woodworth staff orchestrates the robbery of Gimbels department store on Christmas Eve.\n\nAlthough the operation is initially successful, one of the household, Albert (John McGiver), allows himself to be caught to &quot;atone&quot; for his sins. He steadfastly refuses to implicate anyone else. Miss Woodworth casually blackmails the assistant district attorney (&quot;the son of my oldest friend&quot;) into engineering a suspended sentence on a lesser charge, and blithely offers to write a counter check to the store to cover the amount of the take.\n\nBelieving that the entire household is destined for prison, Fitzwilly uncomfortably toasts his and Juliet's engagement with Juliet, her father (Harry Townes) and Miss Vicki. His discomfort is alleviated when it is revealed that Miss Vicki's dictionary has been rewritten as a screenplay, and sold to a Hollywood studio for $500,000.\n\nSOUNDTRACK:-\nThe film features an early symphonic score by John Williams, credited both on the album and on screen as &quot;Johnny Williams&quot;. Notably the score includes &quot;Make Me Rainbows&quot;, the film's love theme and end credits song and Williams' first collaboration with co-writers Alan and Marilyn Bergman.\n\nThe score was released commercially at the time by United Artists (and re-issued in 1980 by MCA Records), and was referred to as the film's &quot;original motion picture score&quot; and not as the &quot;original motion picture soundtrack recording&quot; because instead of performances that had actually been heard in the film Williams opted to release arrangements designed for separate listening. In 2004 a limited edition compact disc was released by VarÃƒÂ¨se Sarabande's CD Club which paired the scores of Fitzwilly and Robert Altman's 1973 film The Long Goodbye, another Williams credit.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4514 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 102 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 102 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8c0dbdccf2068f9322c41d7e63b50d7870fda66","amp;dn":"Fritzwilly+%281967%29+DVD5+-+Dick+Van+Dyke%2C+Barbara+Feldon+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8c0dbdccf2068f9322c41d7e63b50d7870fda66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,192,219,220,207,32,104,249,50,44,65,215,230,59,80,215,135,15,218,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
