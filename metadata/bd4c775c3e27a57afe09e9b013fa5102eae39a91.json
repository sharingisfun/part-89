The topics reference the most common &quot;children's stories&quot; parents read to their kids from the bible.\n\nThe Fall:\nThe fall of man is not just a children's story, but an historical account that teaches us a great deal about God, the accuser, and us. The great temptation is to make ourselves ultimate, to put ourselves in the middle when Christ is the true center of the universe. We must trust God in our temptation, in our sin, and for our redemption. \n\nThe Flood:\nThrough the flood we see an example of GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hatred for sin and the extents he will go in order to destroy it. But we also see his faithfulness. We see that god will always keep his promises, and through His grace He always provides provision for His people to escape the coming wrath. God is patient and gracious with us. May we trust Him like Noah did. \n\nDavid and Goliath:\nThe story of David and Goliath is an excellent picture of courage. In Goliath, we see a man whose courage comes from his trust in his own abilities. In David, we see a man whose courage comes from the power and faithfulness of his God. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough to be brave, but we must be brave because we serve and trust an all powerful God.\n\nDaniel and The Lions' Den:\nAs a follower of Christ do you stand out from the world because of your continual dependence on God? In Daniel 6 we see Daniel stand out and stand firm in his trust of God in spite of the persecution he was receiving. His faithfulness to God caused others to stand amazed at the faithfulness of God. \n\nJonah &amp; The Whale:\nThe story of Jonah teaches us about the mercy and the justice of God. We must be careful not to confuse our idea of justice with the Lord's true justice. When we truly understand what will happen to the enemies of God we must do everything we can to push them toward the God's mercy. We must forgive our enemies for we have been forgiven","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd4c775c3e27a57afe09e9b013fa5102eae39a91","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+The+Word+-+041+-+Children%27s+Stories+by+Watermark+Church","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd4c775c3e27a57afe09e9b013fa5102eae39a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,76,119,92,62,39,165,122,254,9,233,176,19,250,81,2,234,227,154,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
