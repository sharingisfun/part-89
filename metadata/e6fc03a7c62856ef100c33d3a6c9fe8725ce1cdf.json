This album is pure Celtic music on dulcimer. Although the music is expertly played and very engaging, what is even more remarkable is the quality of this recording. Purity, clarity and dynamics are in my experience almost unprecedented, and has drawn looks of disbelief when I used to play it for others on my uber-system. \n\nIf you love music or even if you want to take your hi-fi for a spin and impress your friends, then you have to try this one out. \n\nIf you like what you hear, check out the artists website mark-o.com and support him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6fc03a7c62856ef100c33d3a6c9fe8725ce1cdf","amp;dn":"Mark+Nelson-the+Faery+Hills%2C+audiophile+hammered+dulcimer+Celtic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6fc03a7c62856ef100c33d3a6c9fe8725ce1cdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,252,3,167,198,40,86,239,16,12,51,211,166,201,254,135,37,206,28,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
