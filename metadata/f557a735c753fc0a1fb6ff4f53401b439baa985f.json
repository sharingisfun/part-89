Find out more in Sakura Angels!\n\nSakura Angels tells the story of a high school-aged guy named Kenta who is effectively a loner. Every day is the same: he wakes up without his busy parents present, \ngoes to school and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t interact with anyone, and then returns home. The strangest thing about his daily life is that he has an odd, frightening dream repeatedly. \nAccompanying this are terrible headaches which seem to crop up only at certain times.Still, he goes on through life without complaint just accepting these quirks. \nThis all changes when one day on the way to school his headache takes on a new level of pain and a monster suddenly appears. Just as suddenly, two women in skimpy attire, \nSayaka and Hikari, also show themselves and defeat the creature before Kenta can even grasp what has just occurred. The two suggest theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re guardian angels but keep \neverything else under wraps. Thus begins the surprisingly brief tale of this visual novel.As with many games in this genre youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to sit back most of the time \nsimply reading along. Every so often a dialogue option will pop up and serve as a bit of interactivity to break things up. The ending will change depending on which \nchoices are selected. Thankfully, each decision is rather obvious, making a guide unnecessary to complete all endings.\n\nThis is a complete port! Nothing has changed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f557a735c753fc0a1fb6ff4f53401b439baa985f","amp;dn":"Sakura+Angels+v1.0+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f557a735c753fc0a1fb6ff4f53401b439baa985f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,87,167,53,199,83,252,10,31,182,255,79,83,64,27,67,155,170,152,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
