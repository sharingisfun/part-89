I did not crack them myself. I just decided to search the net and get ahold of the &quot;Walkthroughs&quot; for each game. \n\nReason is when I downloaded this I did so from another PC because my internet was down at the time. After putting it to my computer I started from game 1 and started to play. But when I got stuck I had no way to look up any help so I was very frustrated and had to stop playing because I could go no further.\n\nI did this so others who want to download these games have access to the walkthrough's &quot;Offline&quot; with no worries about getting stuck.\n\nHope I helped!\n\nPlease seed!\n\nThanks! \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cb8a286fcdd62774924ddb88fe817ea0e51bda6","amp;dn":"Virtual_Villagers_1-5_Full_Walkthroughs_Included_%28TigaHotty85%29Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cb8a286fcdd62774924ddb88fe817ea0e51bda6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,184,162,134,252,221,98,119,73,36,221,184,143,232,23,234,14,81,189,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
