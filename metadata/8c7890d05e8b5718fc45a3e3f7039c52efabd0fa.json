Singers like Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also did a great deal to pioneer the form, but Charles did even more to devise a new form of black pop by merging '50s R&amp;B with gospel-powered vocals, adding plenty of flavor from contemporary jazz, blues, and (in the '60s) country. Then there was his singing; his style was among the most emotional and easily identifiable of any 20th century performer, up there with the likes of Elvis and Billie Holiday. He was also a superb keyboard player, arranger, and bandleader. The brilliance of his 1950s and '60s work, however, can't obscure the fact that he made few classic tracks after the mid-'60s, though he recorded often and performed until the year before his death. \n\n\nGenre................: R&amp;B/Soul\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1:\n\n01.Georgia On My Mind\n02.Over The Rainbow\n03.Take These Chains From My Heart\n04.Unchain My Heart\n05.What'd I Say, Part I\n06.I Can't Stop Loving You\n07.Ruby\n08.Crying Time\n09.Hit The Road Jack\n10.That Lucky Old Sun\n11.It Had To Be You\n12.Alone Together\n13.Where Can I Go\n14.Eleanor Rigby\n15.Makin' Believe\n16.I've Got A Woman\n17.Something's Wrong\n18.Mess Around\n19.My Baby (I Love Her, Yes I Do)\n20.3-4 Time\n\n\nCD2:\n\n01.If I Could\n02.Thanks For Bringing Love Around Again\n03.Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word (Feat.
