Hour two begins with some hit and miss phone calls, examines the diversity in law enforcement, and taps into his love of drones. Ant ends the show with an old home movie showcasing his &quot;pissy eyes&quot;, brother Joe calls in, and we view the newest cringe worthy Prancercise video.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b02665ce6e3d5369c8a36270ef09e8b62d1d9049","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-14+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b02665ce6e3d5369c8a36270ef09e8b62d1d9049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,38,101,206,110,61,83,105,200,163,98,112,239,9,232,182,45,29,144,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
