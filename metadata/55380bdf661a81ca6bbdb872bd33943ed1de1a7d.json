Hagar became a true star once he joined Van Halen in 1985, but he'd been a popular hard rocker ever since his first album with Montrose. After giving up a boxing career, Hagar began singing in the late '60s, performing with various California bands including Skinny, the Fabulous Catillas, Justice Brothers, and Dust Cloud. During this time, he built up a solid reputation in the California hard rock scene. Former Edgar Winter guitarist Ronnie Montrose asked Hagar to join his band, Montrose, in 1973. Hagar recorded two albums with Montrose before going solo in 1976, taking the group's bassist, Bill Church, with him. Montrose's drummer Denny Carmassi later joined Hagar's band, along with keyboardist Geoff Workman.\n\n\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Hip-O\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Bad Motor Scooter (Montrose)\n02.Thinking Of You (1974 Demo)\n03.Call My Name (1974 Demo)\n04.Red\n05.I've Done Everything For You\n06.Heavy Metal\n07.I'll Fall In Love Again\n08.There's Only One Way To Rock\n09.Fast Times At Ridgemont High\n10.Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy\n11.Two Sides Of Love\n12.I Can't Drive 55\n13.The Girl Gets Around\n14.Winner Takes It All\n15.Give To Live\n16.Eagles Fly\n17.High Hopes\n18.Little White Lie (Feat.
