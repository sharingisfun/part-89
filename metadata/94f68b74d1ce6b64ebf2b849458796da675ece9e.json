Dedicated to 'my guru Swami Satchidananda'.\n\n\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nFollowing the fulfillment of his two-album contract with Reprise Records and lackluster sales, Fahey was released from \n\nReprise and went back to recording for his own Takoma label.[1]\n\nFahey originally dedicated the album to Swami Satchidananda, but later said the primary reason he was involved with the \n\n&quot;spiritual community in the mountains of Lake County, Northern California&quot; was because he was in love with the Swami's \n\nsecretary. Relating the background to the recording of Fare Forward Voyagers to Byron Coley in his article &quot;The \n\nPersecutions and Resurrections of Blind Joe Death&quot;, Fahey recalled &quot;Probably the primary reason I got involved with them \n\nwas that I fell in love with Swami Satchidananda's secretary, Shanti Norris. So, I was doing benefits for them, hoping to \n\nscore points with her, and along the way I learned a lot of hatha yoga. I could go over there and get food any time I \n\nliked. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe in Krishna or anything. It was like being in the middle of The Thief of Baghdad.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½[2]\n\nThe album and song titles are from American poet T. S. EliotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Four QuartetsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ set of poems. Fahey later said the songs \n\nwere &quot;too demanding&quot; to play live.[3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94f68b74d1ce6b64ebf2b849458796da675ece9e","amp;dn":"John+Fahey+-+1973+-+Fare+Forward+Voyagers+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94f68b74d1ce6b64ebf2b849458796da675ece9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,246,139,116,209,206,107,100,235,242,184,73,69,135,150,218,103,94,206,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
