The song was released in the United States in 1967 for her studio album of the same name. It was successful on the Billboard Hot 100, and peaked at #12. The song is considered by many to be Makeba's signature hit and the song has since been covered by many artists. Originally written and sung in the Xhosa language, the song's title means &quot;touch touch&quot; in English.\n\n                 &quot;Scatterlings&quot;  is a studio album from Juluka, a South African band led by Johnny Clegg and Sipho Mchunu.
