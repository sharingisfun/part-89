While the album finds HoneyHoney offering their most finely crafted melodies and richly textured sound to date, the band also embodies a loose and scrappy energy drawn out with some help from Cobb. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dave never let me obsess over my vocals,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Santo, whose sultry but tender voice intensifies the intimacy of each track. Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d just be like, Ã¢â‚¬ËœNope, that was raw, we got it, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Adds Jaffe: Ã¢â‚¬Å“He didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really allow us to overthink anything, which is great for what we do Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the more barriers you can remove to get to the soul of it, the better.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nRating 9/10 \n\nTracklist: \n01 - Big Man.flac \n02 - Yours to Bear.flac \n03 - Back to You.flac \n04 - Whatchya Gonna Do Now.flac \n05 - Numb It.flac \n06 - Bad People.flac \n07 - Burned Me Out.flac \n08 - You and I.flac \n09 - Father's Daughter.flac \n10 - God of Love.flac \n11 - Sweet Thing.flac \n12 - Marry Rich.flac \n\n\nSummary: \nCountry: USA \nGenre: Indie-Folk \n\n\nMedia Report: \nSource : CD \nFormat : FLAC \nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM \nBit rate mode : Variable \nBit rate : ~742-972 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d729fc01476163b0d0ce120151e3d07f92f616","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Honeyhoney+-+3+%5BFLAC%2Ctracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d729fc01476163b0d0ce120151e3d07f92f616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,215,41,252,1,71,97,99,176,208,206,18,1,81,227,208,127,146,246,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
