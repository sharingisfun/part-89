All are encouraged to watch.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLast Days Deception by David Wilkerson:\nIn this audio/video sermon, David Wilkerson delivers the Last Days Deception in USA (Must Hear) - but I also say to you this is also in the UK and many parts of the world today. In the living gospel, the apostles preached to the brethren warning of another Jesus, a perversion of the one and only true gospel of Christ Jesus.  Galatians 1:9; &quot;If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.&quot;\n\n\nThis entire torrent download is to help the brethren better understand the indoctrination of Roman Catholicism and the troubles leading the church into the end-times and why the later great deception is able to convinve so many believers of the grander Lie, falling victim to the miracles and wonders of the antichrist.  This is highly recommended for all believers as your future rests on this wisdom.  God bless and may the Lord Jesus Christ light your way.  Please repent and be saved.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Armory of Truth, Parts 1-6 with Richard Rives:\nReferencing his book, &quot;Too Long in the Sun&quot;, Richard Rives shows how the bible prophecy found in 2 Corinthians 11:4 speaking of those who &quot;preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him&quot; is prevelant among the indoctrinated church of today.  Unfortunately the flock remains unaware as its pastors lead the sheep astray.\n\n\n\nThanks to Richard Rives we can see how the Devil subtly deceives unwary humans into following a different Gospel than the one Jesus Christ gave us. Mr. Rives helps us to open our eyes to Satan's incredible deceptions in using the very name of Christ. Spiritual warfare is our Christian mission not conformity to a pagan beliefs embraced by the church. God expects us to prove all things about Bible doctrines and churches to see if they are in the truths of God, John 14:6, 1 Thessalonians 5:14-24.

Those of us who take belief in the God of the Bible seriously feel burdened by the problems that arise in our increasingly secular, pluralistic society. People are abandoning truth, Western culture is dying, and the lines between right and wrong are becoming irrevocably blurred.\n\nThe goal of this event is to allow two prominent voices in the public square -- one Jewish (Prager), and one evangelical Christian (Ravi) -- to engage in an open, honest and entertaining dialogue about these challenges we face as a nation and civilization. This is about asking and answering tough questions in a God-honoring and purposeful way.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ten Virgins:\n119 Ministries presents the biblical understanding for the ten virgins parable found in scipture.  The parable of the ten virgins is a passionate subject with those who desire to study Biblical end times. Many are often left with the question, &quot;What does this mean?&quot; ...or we assume we know what it means. In this study, we simplify the parable, by allowing the Bible to literally interpret the Bible.\n-------------------\n\nThe Sabbath Day:\nThis is a very interesting sermon that deeply delves into the topic of the Sabbath day examining its significance.  We've all been told that the Sabbath is now on Sunday.  But how many of us have truly tested that?  Have we truly examined the basis of this belief?  Or have we just blindly accepted what we have been taught over recent generations based on the interpretations of man's views of the scriptures passed down over the years?  We at 119 Ministries present this examination of the scriptures regarding the one day that was given as a sign and covenant for those who choose to follow our Heavenly Father.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFaith, The Prerequisites:\nToday you begin the journey. Somewhere in America is our &quot;Elijah,&quot; a ordinary man or woman gifted of God with great faith! Where are you? We need you! Perhaps you are that person. Learn how to wield the power of God to bring glory to his name.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIdol Christians:\nThe truth about spirituality in Church families.  Please be forewarned, this is very disturbing news.  For those with ears, let them hear!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMystery Religions - Pagan Practices in Christianity:\nA Documentary styled interview with Richard Rives on the pagan practices that have crept into the Christian Church and the unbiblical practices of Catholicism.  Sorry about the spiratic choppiness in the video, but it's the best copy I could find.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe History of the Trinity:\nWhat does the Bible reveal about the nature of God? Is God a mysterious unity of three co-equal and co-eternal Persons as most Christians believe? Who or what is the Holy Spirit? Is there is a reason why there is so much confusion about the nature and identity of the Holy Spirit? Is our God the Author of confusion? Or is it possible instead that most Christians have simply been deceived about the nature of God? Is it possible that what most Christians believe today about God's nature actually has its origins in ancient pagan mysticism and not the Bible?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e7710d3c278c46855c62154b1c02e952d1287e","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+End+Times+-+78+-+Walking+by+Faith+the+Armory+of+Truth+pt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e7710d3c278c46855c62154b1c02e952d1287e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,231,113,13,60,39,140,70,133,92,98,21,75,28,2,233,82,209,40,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
