The group composes its own works in which jazz style is mixed with elements of Hungarian and African music. The band has performed internationally at several festivals. Moreover, they worked together with musicians, such as Steve Hackett and Ben Castle. The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recordings are published by Gramy Records.\n\nThis concert film was recorded in Budapest, at the Pecsa Music Hall. It was one of the live surround shows of the Down And Up album tour. The album and the tour, especially the live 5.1 audio experience meant a milestone in the band's history. At the show even the lights turned blue. This show is really unbeatable performance in the jazz/world scene. To enjoy the blue show, put your Blu-Ray disc into your player, sit back, relax, and turn the volume up. The DTS-HD 5.1 audio recreates the original experience of this concert in your home.\n\nLive In Blue (2hours)\n\nLive at the IBS (44 minutes) with Steve Hackett\n\nMiskolc acoustic set (19 minutes)\n\nTears For Peace video clip (7 minutes)\n\nAudio: Stereo wav, Surround 5.1 DTS-HD Audio\nSubtitled in English, aspect ratio 16:9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e4586aaeec78c36fda00f20a0013ba7978bb0a9","amp;dn":"Djabe+-+Live+In+Blue+BD25","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e4586aaeec78c36fda00f20a0013ba7978bb0a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,69,134,170,238,199,140,54,253,160,15,32,160,1,59,167,151,139,176,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
