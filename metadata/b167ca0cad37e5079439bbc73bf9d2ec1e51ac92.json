As our powers grow, so do the threats against us. My name is Emma Carter I am a sixteen year old high school student who lives with five brothers, my father and his stupid girlfriend. I have three best friends and love to skateboard. You give me a title and think you can control me. I am more than just a pawn, some reincarnated soldier. I am done playing by your rules! And youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re saying I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a choice? Well I am choosing and you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop me! Separately we are impressive, but together we are a force to be feared. The choices we make determine the fate of the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b167ca0cad37e5079439bbc73bf9d2ec1e51ac92","amp;dn":"Chosen_Twisted+Fate+%5BBook+2%5D+By+Kathryn+Tracy+%28PDF%29+%5BDTW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b167ca0cad37e5079439bbc73bf9d2ec1e51ac92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,103,202,12,173,55,229,7,148,57,187,199,59,249,210,236,30,81,172,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
