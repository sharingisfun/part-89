Written by established leading experts and influential young researchers, the first volume of this popular handbook examines the elements involved in designing and implementing software, new areas in which computers are being used, and ways to solve computing problems. The book also explores our current understanding of software engineering and its effect on the practice of software development and the education of software professionals.\n\nLike the second volume, this first volume describes what occurs in research laboratories, educational institutions, and public and private organizations to advance the effective development and use of computers and computing in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world. Research-level survey articles provide deep insights into the computing discipline, enabling readers to understand the principles and practices that drive computing education, research, and development in the twenty-first century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d6a30e53b532f81d6d2f6e3e97c8e0b889a923d","amp;dn":"Computing+Handbook+3rd+Ed%3A+Computer+Science+and+Software+Enginee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d6a30e53b532f81d6d2f6e3e97c8e0b889a923d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,106,48,229,59,83,47,129,214,210,246,227,233,124,142,11,136,154,146,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
