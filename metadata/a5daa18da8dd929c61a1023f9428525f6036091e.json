Having fled the F'dor - an ancient, powerful evil - the three emerged on the other side of the world only to discover 14 centuries had passed.\n\nThis is the second in the Symphony of Ages series. Like Rhapsody, I've cleaned up the audio, chapterized the book, and updated all the tags. This series is, for me, a test to see how much the community likes this sort of thing. If it gets a strong positive response, I've got tons of other books I've done the same thing too I'd love to share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5daa18da8dd929c61a1023f9428525f6036091e","amp;dn":"Prophecy%3A+Child+of+Earth+-+Elizabeth+Haydon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5daa18da8dd929c61a1023f9428525f6036091e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,218,161,141,168,221,146,156,97,161,2,63,148,40,82,95,96,54,9,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
