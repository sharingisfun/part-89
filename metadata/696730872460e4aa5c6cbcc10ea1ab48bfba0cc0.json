Inevitably, there were numerous comic moments, but Steel avoided knockabout treatment of the lecture format (of the kind used by Jeremy Hardy in Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation), frequently playing it entirely straight as he presented his own opinions on the French, Russian, industrial and sexual revolutions, plus the revolutionary consequences of the American Civil War and Darwin's theory of natural selection. In attempting to combine genuine historical comment and insight with sufficient humour to avoid alienating the audience, Steel set himself a difficult task, and it's to his credit that he just about pulled it off. Readings during the shows were delivered by Carla MendonÃƒÂ§a and Martin Hyder. \n\nCast:\nMark Steel\nCarla Mendoca\nMartin Hyder\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Mark Steel Lectures:\n\nA series of radio and television programmes. Written and delivered by Mark Steel, each scripted lecture presents persuasive, yet witty, arguments for the importance of a historical figure.\n\nThe lectures were originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 over three series between 1999 and 2002. Many of the arguments were illustrated by miniature sketches. \n\nCast:\nMark Steel\nMelanie Hudson\nMartin Hyder\nCarla MendonÃƒÂ§a\nDebbie Isitt\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMark Steel's In Town \n\n\nMark Steel visits the less-famous bits of Britain and investigates the funniest moments in their history. \nHe then performs a stand-up show to locals\n\nComedian Mark Steel visits different towns from across the UK and delves into their history, people and idiosyncrasies to try to work out what ingredients combine to make the place distinctive.\n\nHe creates a bespoke stand-up show for that community and then performs the show in front of a local audience in a celebration of the sort of places in Britain which are generally less visited as tourist attractions. Each has their own fascinating stories to tell with inhabitants who are passionate about what their home has to offer.\n\nAmongst the topics Mark touched upon included the canals of Skipton, the concrete hippo in Walsall, and the Isle of Portland's strong dislike of a certain fluffy animal beginning with the letter &quot;R&quot;.\n\n\n\nDedicated Troublemaker\n\n\nI've Never Seen Star Wars - S01 - E03 - Mark Steel\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:696730872460e4aa5c6cbcc10ea1ab48bfba0cc0","amp;dn":"Mark+Steel+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"696730872460e4aa5c6cbcc10ea1ab48bfba0cc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,103,48,135,36,96,228,170,92,108,188,193,14,161,171,72,191,186,12,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
