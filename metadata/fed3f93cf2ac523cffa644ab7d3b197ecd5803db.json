First, it is the only religion which claims to be, and is, the final, the universal and eternal religion for all times and for all peoples. Second, it is the only religion which acknowledges, and bears witness to, the veracity of every other religions and claims that the truth is not the monopoly of Islam aloneÃ¢â‚¬â€whereas every other religion claims that it alone contains the Divine truth.\n\nThen Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad (rh) answers at some length the question that if all religions are from God then why is there any difference in religions. Moreover he argues three main points: that Islamic teachings are not only universal and eternal but are also complete, comprehensive and perfect; that the Holy Quran is the final and immutable word of God free from all human interpolation; and that the Prophet of Islam, the Holy Prophet Muhammad (sa) is the Seal of the ProphetsÃ¢â‚¬â€the best of themÃ¢â‚¬â€and the perfect model of excellence for mankind.\n\nIn the middle part of lecture he discuses seventeen features of Islam which distinguish it from other religion and ideologies including the Islamic concept of justice and Islamic teachings regarding the form and function of government. At the end the speaker introduces the Founder of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and the Community itself to his audience concluding his lecture with an excerpt from the writings of the Promised Messiah (as).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n\nContact for more details:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial websites:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fed3f93cf2ac523cffa644ab7d3b197ecd5803db","amp;dn":"Some+Distinctive+Features+of+Islam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fed3f93cf2ac523cffa644ab7d3b197ecd5803db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,211,249,60,242,172,82,60,255,166,68,171,125,59,25,126,205,88,3,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
