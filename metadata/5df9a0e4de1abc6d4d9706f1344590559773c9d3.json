Take a listen.  Luke Bryan has another song debuting this week as well, but at least this time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the actual single his record label are promoting (unlike Games which was never released as a single supposedly).  Time for me to take some time away from the PC and head off for a little vacation, so there wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be a torrent for Tues June 9.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be back June 23 hopefully with 30 of the hottest U.S. Country songs as ranked by Mediabase.\n\n01 Billy Currington - Don't It (3:04)\n02 A Thousand Horses - Smoke (3:35)\n03 Florida-Georgia Line - Sippin' On Fire (3:09)\n04 Kenny Chesney &amp; Grace Potter - Wild Child (3:05)\n05 Carrie Underwood - Little Toy Guns (3:28)\n06 Easton Corbin - Baby Be My Love Song (3:16)\n07 Tyler Farr - A Guy Walks Into A Bar (3:10)\n08 Kelsea Ballerini - Love Me Like You Mean It (3:12)\n09 Blake Shelton - Sangria (3:45)\n10 Tim McGraw &amp; Catherine Dunn - Diamond Rings And Old Bar Stools (3:11)\n11 Keith Urban &amp; Eric Church - Raise 'Em Up (2:56)\n12 Canaan Smith - Love You Like That (3:19)\n13 Little Big Town - Girl Crush (3:10)\n14 Brad Paisley - Crushin' It (radio edit) (3:20)\n15 Jason Aldean - Tonight Looks Good On You (3:45)\n16 Frankie Ballard - Young &amp; Crazy (2:56)\n17 Brantley Gilbert - One Hell Of An Amen (3:34)\n18 Michael Ray - Kiss You In The Morning (2:58)\n19 Eric Paslay - She Don't Love You (3:59)\n20 Rascal Flatts - Riot (3:41)\n21 Zac Brown Band - Loving You Easy (2:30)\n22 Dustin Lynch - Hell Of A Night (3:07)\n23 Gloriana - Trouble (3:07)\n24 Eric Chirch - Like a Wrecking Ball (3:10)\n25 Luke Bryan - Games (2:52)\n26 Kip Moore - I'm To Blame (2:14)\n27 Thomas Rhett - Crash And Burn (3:08)\n28 Luke Bryan - Kick The Dust Up (3:08)\n29 Maddie &amp; Tae - Fly (3:33)\n30 Brett Eldredge - Lose My Mind (2:34)\n\n\nRECURRENT Dierks Bentley - Say You Do (3:30)\nRECURRENT Lee Brice - Drinking Class (3:19)\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5df9a0e4de1abc6d4d9706f1344590559773c9d3","amp;dn":"Top+30+Country+May+26%2C+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5df9a0e4de1abc6d4d9706f1344590559773c9d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,249,160,228,222,26,188,109,77,151,6,241,52,69,144,85,151,115,201,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
