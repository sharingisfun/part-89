Gannon -  Fire with Fire (Tales of the Terran Republic #1)\n\n\n\n\nAn agent for a spy organization uncovers an alien alliance in nearby interstellar spaceÃ¢â‚¬â€an alliance that will soon involve humanity in politics and war on a galactic scale.2105, September: Intelligence Analyst Caine Riordan uncovers a conspiracy on EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MoonÃ¢â‚¬â€a history-changing clandestine projectÃ¢â‚¬â€and ends up involuntarily cryocelled for his troubles. Twelve years later, Riordan awakens to a changed world. Humanity has achieved faster-than-light travel and is pioneering nearby star systems. And now, Riordan is compelled to become an inadvertent agent of conspiracy himself. RiordanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission: travel to a newly settled world and investigate whether a primitive local species was once sentientÃ¢â‚¬â€enough so to have built a lost civilization.\n\nHowever, arriving on site in the Delta Pavonis system, Caine discovers that the job heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been given is anything but secret or safe. With assassins and saboteurs dogging his every step, it's clear that someone doesn't want his mission to succeed. In the end, it takes the broad-based insights of an intelligence analyst and a matching instinct for intrigue to ferret out the truth: that humanity is neither alone in the cosmos nor safe. Earth is revealed to be the lynchpin planet in an impending struggle for interstellar dominance, a struggle into which it is being irresistibly dragged. Discovering new dangers at every turn, Riordan must now convince the powers-that-be that the only way for humanity to survive as a free species is to face the perils directlyÃ¢â‚¬â€and to fight fire with fire.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e2e63030304ca4439e3647713b637d9804ae11c","amp;dn":"Charles+E.+Gannon+-++Fire+with+Fire+%28Tales+of+the+Terran+Republi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e2e63030304ca4439e3647713b637d9804ae11c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,46,99,3,3,4,202,68,57,227,100,119,19,182,55,217,128,74,225,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
