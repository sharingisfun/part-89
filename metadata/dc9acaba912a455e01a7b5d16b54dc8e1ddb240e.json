Why? Government handouts encouraged poor Americans to become dependent. Teaching a man to be self-reliant helps him far more, and private charities and markets do a much better job of this than government.\n\nBIG GOVERNMENT VS. CAPITALISM: There are three ways to help people: Government, charity, or free markets. Markets work better than charity, and charity works better than government, but when I asked people whether government or capitalism helps people more, most said charity or government. If you study the data, its clear markets are superior to charity.\n\nCAPITALISM THAT CARES: Another example of how markets work better than government: Obamacare requires everyone to have health insurance, but government-approved insurance distorts the market and raises prices. Fortunately, some medical clinics don't take health insurance. We went to check one of these places out.\n\nSLACKTIVISM: By now, we've all heard of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Lots of people did that and posted it to their Facebook pages. The Ice Bucket Challenge did raise a lot of money, but often people donated nothing. Sumpto.com founder Ben Kosinski calls that &quot;Slacktivism.&quot;\n\nPRISON UNIVERSITY: 20 years ago President Clinton decided that taxpayers shouldn't be forced to fund college for prisoners through Pell grants. So a charity called Hudson Link stepped in to offer courses. Now it does a much better job than government. Prisoners who were previously uninspired now want to do well.\n\nMY TAKE: This is the season for giving. But let's not forget that the people who do the most for the poor are capitalists, honest ones, the majority who create things rather than feeding off government. They do more good for the world than government and the politicians who promise &quot;public service&quot;.\n\n-\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2014.12.18.Charity.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 351 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 193 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf54.63.104\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 054 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.121\nStream size                              : 310 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9acaba912a455e01a7b5d16b54dc8e1ddb240e","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.12.18.Charity.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9acaba912a455e01a7b5d16b54dc8e1ddb240e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,154,202,186,145,42,69,94,1,167,181,209,107,84,220,142,29,219,36,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
