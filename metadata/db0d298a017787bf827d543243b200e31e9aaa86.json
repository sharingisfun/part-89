He follows a Taliban commander, who rises from scrawny teenager to leading insurgent; a US-backed warlord, who uses the American military to gain personal wealth and power; and a village housewife trapped between the two sides, who discovers the devastating cost of neutrality.\n\nThrough their dramatic stories, Gopal shows that the Afghan war, so often regarded as a hopeless quagmire, could in fact have gone very differently. Top Taliban leaders actually tried to surrender within months of the US invasion, renouncing all political activity and submitting to the new government. Effectively, the Taliban ceased to existÃ¢â‚¬â€yet the Americans were unwilling to accept such a turnaround. Instead, driven by false intelligence from their allies and an unyielding mandate to fight terrorism, American forces continued to press the conflict, resurrecting the insurgency that persists to this day.\n\nWith its intimate accounts of life in war-torn Afghanistan, GopalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoroughly original reporting lays bare the workings of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest war and the truth behind its prolonged agony. A heartbreaking story of mistakes and misdeeds, No Good Men Among the Living challenges our usual perceptions of the Afghan conflict, its victims, and its supposed winners","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0d298a017787bf827d543243b200e31e9aaa86","amp;dn":"Anand+Gopal+-+No+Good+Men+Among+the+Living+%282015%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0d298a017787bf827d543243b200e31e9aaa86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,13,41,138,1,119,135,191,130,125,84,50,67,178,0,227,30,154,170,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
