Like any child, Chappie will come under the influence of his surroundings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ some good, some bad Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he will rely on his heart and soul to find his way in the world and become his own man. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing that makes Chappie different from anyone else: he is a robot. The first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. His life, his story, will change the way the world looks at robots and humans forever.\n\n\nRating: 7.3/10 (33657 votes)\nDirector: Neill Blomkamp\nWriter: Neill Blomkamp, Terri Tatchell\nStars: Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel, Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser\nRuntime: 120 min\nRated: R\nGenre: Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller\n\n\nSize: 897MB\nVideo: MPEG-4 | 1280Ãƒâ€”528 | 912 Kbps\nAudio: English | AAC 2Ch | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 2h 00mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96023becd356feed7af25854baf96fd40bd86b77","amp;dn":"Chappie+%282015%29+BRRip+720p+-+MrKickASS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96023becd356feed7af25854baf96fd40bd86b77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,2,59,236,211,86,254,237,122,242,88,84,186,249,111,212,11,216,107,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
