Burgess\n\nExcerpt:\n\nThen he saved a nice fat trout and waited.\n\nBy and by along came Little Joe Otter, chuckling to think how he had spoiled Buster Bear's fishing. He was so intent on looking behind him to see if Buster was coming that he didn't see Buster waiting there until he spoke.\n\n&quot;I'm much obliged for the fine breakfast you have given me,&quot; said Buster in his deepest, most grumbly-rumbly voice. &quot;I've saved a fat trout for you to make up for the one I ate yesterday. I hope we'll go fishing together often.&quot;\n\nThen he went off laughing fit to kill himself. Little Joe couldn't find a word to say. He was so surprised and angry that he went off by himself and sulked. And Billy Mink, who had been watching, ate the fat trout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3726a564b477c0b07da2306b0a5724875caf7c4d","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Buster+Bear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3726a564b477c0b07da2306b0a5724875caf7c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,38,165,100,180,119,192,176,125,162,48,107,10,87,36,135,92,175,124,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
