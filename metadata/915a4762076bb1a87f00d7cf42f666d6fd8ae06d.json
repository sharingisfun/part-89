With her warm, guileless vocals and earnest, evocative songwriting, Tristen has emerged as a truly individual talent, bridging genres and emotions to create a distinctive sound all her own. Born Tristen Gaspadarek, she grew up in the Chicago suburb of Lansing, Illinois, where her musician father, instilled in her a love of music. She began singing from the time she could speak, took up the piano at the tender age of 8, and, inspired by her local oldies radio station and The Beatles, began writing her own songs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:915a4762076bb1a87f00d7cf42f666d6fd8ae06d","amp;dn":"Tristen+-+Caves+%282013%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"915a4762076bb1a87f00d7cf42f666d6fd8ae06d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,90,71,98,7,107,177,168,127,0,215,207,66,246,102,214,253,138,224,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
