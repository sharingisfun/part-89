The W-CODE software is designed to work with your existing\n    equipment -no proprietary hardware required. It allows seamless\n    integration with SDR (Software Defined Radio) receivers with IQ data or\n    digital audio outputs. One client license provided with each software\n    package. W-CODE provides all functions required to analyze, decode and\n    process radio data communications throughout the spectrum (HF, VHF, UHF,\n    SHF).\n    \n    The COMINT Solution for\n    Government Agencies\n    Homeland and Government Security Agencies\n    Defence Contractors\n    Telecommunications Authorities\n    Defence Signal Corps\n\n    Features:\n    TCP/IP data input (LAN) for IQ or PCM coded data. Data conversion to the\n    WAVECOM format is done by a separate, external application. Internal\n    sampling rate converter Decoding from PC soundcard (sampling rates up to\n    192 kHz are supported) Direct decoding from audio files VAC (Virtual\n    Audio Cable) support. Tested with a number of Software Defined Radios\n    (SDR) e.g. WiNRADiO, Perseus, RF-SPACE SDR14/SDRIQ, MEDAV LR2 \n    Tested with ICOM R9500 (S/PDIF-output, rx has no IQ/IF output)\n    Tested with ICOM R2500 (rx has no IQ/IF output )\n    Drivers for other SDRs (IZT, R+S, EADS, AOR etc.) on request\n    More than 180 modes are currently implemented, including INMARSAT\n    New modes: Robust-Packet-Radio, CLOVER2, CLOVER2000, PACTOR3, CODAN9001\n    Powerful 48 and 96 kHz wideband FFT\n    Adaptive Equalizer for high-speed PSK protocols\n    Additional external input device under development (multi-input AF/IF/70\n    MHz, tunable 0-25 MHz and 52.5-87.5MHz)\n    XML Remote Control Interface with the same command set  as the W61PC\n    Optional INMARSAT monitoring mode for data, fax and voice with\n    additional external WAVECOM input device\n    Optional software classifier plug-in with 4 and 8 kHz bandwidth and FSK,\n    MFSK, PKS, and OFDM support\n    Pass band filters to mitigate poor propagation conditions or process\n    wideband receiver input\n    In preparation: New function to add customer specific alphabets","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77e2528f1b781709563763a3d663cc2f7a74c09","amp;dn":"Wavecom+7.1+full+cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77e2528f1b781709563763a3d663cc2f7a74c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,126,37,40,241,183,129,112,149,99,118,58,61,102,60,194,247,167,76,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
