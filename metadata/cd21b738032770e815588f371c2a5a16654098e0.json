Released in 1965, this was a first time attempt to blend music and nature sound effects, specifically, a California thunderstorm. The album was a great success, and spawned a whole series of MYSTIC MOODS LPs over several decades. Another &quot;first&quot; this one can lay claim to is the earliest use of a fully transistorized mixing board.\n\nAt various moments throughout ONE STORMY NIGHT, thunderclaps, cloudbursts and other sounds blend perfectly with the tone of the songs. The orchestrations are appropriately restrained and pensive. A sound collage of freight train and rain is quite effective, as well. This is still a most lovely set of easy listening music, and is highly recommended.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/0iESZTNfbH.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Mystic Moods Orchestra, The - One Stormy Night (Bainbridge 6205)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Mystic Moods Orchestra, The\nAlbum................: One Stormy Night (Bainbridge 6205)\nGenre................: Instrumental\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1972\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 54 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size. If you love \nFLAC then you'll know MP3 V0 is your other buddy for going mobile when \nspace and quality are a concern\n\nThe AccurateRip data is embedded in the MP3 tags so you can look at any \ntrack to validate the accuracy of the rip.\n\n- Big Papi\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd21b738032770e815588f371c2a5a16654098e0","amp;dn":"Mystic+Moods+Orchestra%2C+The+-+One+Stormy+Night+%28Bainbridge+6205%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd21b738032770e815588f371c2a5a16654098e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,33,183,56,3,39,112,232,21,88,143,55,28,42,90,22,101,64,152,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
