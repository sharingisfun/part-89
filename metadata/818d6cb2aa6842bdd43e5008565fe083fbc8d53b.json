It was a tragedy of errors, in which both sides shared responsibility for a conflict that cost the lives of at least twenty thousand Britons and a still larger number of Americans. The British and the colonists failed to see how swiftly they were drifting toward violence until the process had gone beyond the point of no return.\n\nAt the heart of the book lies the Boston Tea Party, an event that arose from fundamental flaws in the way the British managed their affairs. By the early 1770s, Great Britain had become a nation addicted to financial speculation, led by a political elite beset by internal rivalry and increasingly baffled by a changing world. When the East India Company came close to collapse, it patched together a rescue plan whose disastrous side effect was the destruction of the tea.\n\n\nWith lawyers in London calling the Tea Party treason, and with hawks in Parliament crying out for revenge, the British opted for punitive reprisals without foreseeing the resistance they would arouse. For their part, Americans underestimated BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determination not to give way. By the late summer of 1774, when the rebels in New England began to arm themselves, the descent into war had become irreversible. \n           \n\nDrawing on careful study of primary sources from Britain and the United States, An Empire on the Edge sheds new light on the Tea PartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s origins and on the roles of such familiar characters as Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, and Thomas Hutchinson. The book shows how the kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chief minister, Lord North, found himself driven down the road to bloodshed. At his side was Lord Dartmouth, the colonial secretary, an evangelical Christian renowned for his benevolence. In a story filled with painful ironies, perhaps the saddest was this: that Dartmouth, a man who loved peace, had to write the dispatch that sent the British army out to fight.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\nNick Bunker is the author of Making Haste from Babylon, a history of the Mayflower Pilgrims, described by The Washington Post as &quot;a remarkable success.&quot; Educated at KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s College, Cambridge, and Columbia University, he was a journalist for the Liverpool Echo and the Financial Times, and then an investment banker, chiefly with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. During his careers in journalism and finance, he traveled widely in China, India, the former Soviet bloc, and the United States. He now lives in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n\nPublisher: Knopf\nPublished: Sep 16, 2014\nPages: 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:818d6cb2aa6842bdd43e5008565fe083fbc8d53b","amp;dn":"An+Empire+on+the+Edge+-+Nick+Bunker+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"818d6cb2aa6842bdd43e5008565fe083fbc8d53b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,141,108,178,170,104,66,189,212,62,80,8,86,95,224,131,251,200,213,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
