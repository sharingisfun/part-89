Especially JLH's show is worth a closer look. He was supported by Chicago Blues band The Kingsnakes (not to confuse with the British King Snakes) and also by some guest musicians - Willy Dixon, Buddy Guy, Wayne Bennet, Roy Rogers, Charlie Musselwhite &amp; Buddy Miles.\nThanks to the original uploader. I only added tags, run audiocheckers and corrected some song titles. Still I'm not sure, if they are all correct. Maybe one of you downloaders can help:\nCD3 track4 - JLH's first song  was titled Long Long Baby in the original upload &amp; Have Mercy On Me on guitars101.com. Both is wrong - but what's right?\nCD3 track8 - Mabel (?) - it's definetely not JLH's well known Funky Mabel\nCD3 track10 was titled Move Baby (?) in the original upload - guitars101.com suggests Doin' the Shout (from Endless Boogie) - guess that's right, but I have to admit, the songs reminds me a lot at James Brown's Shout &amp; Shimmy. - maxblues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc46ed2961f577cbbb2f0b4b01222f74d7ac135","amp;dn":"VA+%28John+Lee+Hooker%2C+Ruth+Brown%29+-+Chicago+Blues+Festival+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc46ed2961f577cbbb2f0b4b01222f74d7ac135","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,196,110,210,150,31,87,124,187,178,240,180,176,18,34,247,77,122,193,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
