This is by far her best album, released in 1995, just when the 'angry woman' movement spearheaded by Alanis took off...Indeed I purchased this album on the same day as I got Jagged Little Pill. This approaches a demise of a relationship from a much more mature, introspective and less excoriating fashion. The other party actually produced this album, so it was (I think) a positive step towards healing. \n\nI have described this in the past as pain without self pity, and in this way has much in common with Janis Ian's work of art-Between the Lines. \n\nThe production here is sensitive, lost of acoustic guitar, soft lilting melodies and enough production to carry it through. \n\nOne of the decades best releases, and to this day still holds up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77e7892a9c71ff4bfc099a2746c3448345c3deb","amp;dn":"Lori+Carson-Where+it+Goes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77e7892a9c71ff4bfc099a2746c3448345c3deb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,126,120,146,169,199,31,244,191,192,153,162,116,108,52,72,52,92,61,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
