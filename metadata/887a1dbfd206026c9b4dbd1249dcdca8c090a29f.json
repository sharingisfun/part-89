The Spoon virtual machine supports all versions of the .NET Framework and Java, including .NET 4.0, 4.2, and 4.5.\nExecute on Locked-Down Desktops\n\nBoost security by locking down desktops and deploying on clean base images. Spoon allows all of your applications to work properly without administrative rights or access to privileged system resources.\nEliminate Component Failures\n\nSpoon eliminates application failures due to missing or mismatched component versions by packaging runtimes and other application components together with dependent application executables.\nRun Legacy Applications on Windows 8\n\nSpoon allows legacy applications such as Internet Explorer 6 to run properly on new operating systems such as Windows 7 and 8, reducing the cost and risk associated with operating system rollouts.\nDynamic Sandbox Isolation Management\n\nDynamic isolation management allows virtualized applications to run both in complete isolation or in shared virtual environments with other applications, allowing data and settings to be shared between related applications.\nEasy to Understand\nApplication Templates\n\nThe Configuration Wizard provides templates for popular applications. Automatically virtualize common applications such as Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, Adobe Creative Suite, Firefox, and Chrome.\nDesktop Import Wizard\n\nStudio's unique Desktop Import Wizard scans the local desktop, automatically identifies installed applications, and then creates a virtual machine configuration using settings and content from the local desktop.\nOne-Click Configuration of .NET, Java, and AIR\n\nStudio provides single-click, automated virtualization of popular runtimes and components such as the .NET Framework, Java, and Adobe AIR. Spoon supports all versions of the .NET Framework, including .NET 4.0, 4.2, and 4.5.\nNo Infrastructure Changes\n\nNo client installation, device drivers, or other infrastructure changes are required. Spoon is fully compatible with existing desktop management infrastructure such as Microsoft System Center, LANDesk, Altiris, and KACE. Or, distribute and manage virtual applications with the included Spoon Server.\nImport Existing MSI and ThinApp Packages\n\nStudio features one-click import of existing MSI setup, VMware ThinApp, and Novell AXT packages. Or, access thousands of pre-packaged applications on Spoon.net.\nSetup Snapshotting\n\nConfiguring even the most complex proprietary application is as easy as setting it up on a clean machine. Studio's snapshotting feature takes &quot;before and after&quot; images of your system and automatically constructs the virtual application configuration.\nApp Virtualization Engine\n#1 in Compatibility\n\nSpoon is the only virtualization engine in its class to support virtualization of both 32- and 64-bit applications; system services and databases such as SQL Server; and advanced software technologies such as DCOM and SxS.\nFully User-Mode Virtual Machine\n\nFully user-mode implementation eliminates the need for device drivers, reboots, and administrative privileges. Deployment models include standalone EXE, MSI package, and HTTP-based delivery via the Spoon browser plugin.\nRun Legacy Applications on Windows 8\n\nSpoon allows legacy applications such as Internet Explorer 6 to run properly on Windows 7 and 8, reducing the costs and risks associated with operating system rollouts and assuring business continuity.\nMulti-Platform Capabilities\n\nPlatform merge allows virtual application behavior to be customized on a per-operating system basis while distributing a single, universal executable. The Spoon virtualization engine automatically resolves incompatibilities between multiple operating system variants.\nAdvanced Sandbox Isolation Management\n\nDynamic isolation management allows applications to run both in complete isolation or in shared virtual environments. Sandbox sharing enables data and settings to be shared between related applications.\nUnprecedented Performance\n\nSpoon virtualization executes applications at nearly the same speed as native binaries. No host operating system is required, dramatically reducing payload size and providing dramatically superior performance relative to hardware-level virtualization.\nPublish Anywhere\nCreate Standalone EXEs\n\nStandalone executable generation packages all virtual machine and application payload content as a single EXE file that can be deployed using any standard file delivery mechanism or existing desktop management infrastructure.\nIntegrated Application Management\n\nIncluded Spoon Server allows applications virtualized with Studio to be deployed, patched, and managed on your intranet. Spoon Server is over 20 times more scaleable than RDP-based deployment.\nBring Your Application to the Cloud\n\nIncluded Spoon.net application hosting allows you to publish directly from the web. Launch applications instantly from your web site, syndicate on blogs and social networks, or deploy Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings.\nGenerate MSI Setup Packages\n\nVirtualized applications can be deployed using traditional MSI setup packages. Studio-generated MSIs perform binary installation, Start Menu and desktop shortcut creation, file association mapping, and uninstalls.\nDesktop Registration\n\nScriptable SpoonReg shell registration tool configures all Start Menu shortcuts and file associations. Broadcast applications to desktops using scripting in conjunction with existing management infrastructure.\nDeploy on USB Flash Drives\n\nEnable mobile work scenarios and create compelling marketing materials by embedding your application on portable USB flash drives. Settings migrate automatically on the portable storage device.\nComprehensive Platform\nPackage Once, Deploy Everywhere\n\nMulti-modal distribution allows virtualized applications to be deployed as standalone EXEs and MSIs, in private clouds using Spoon Server, or over the Internet with Spoon.net.\nBuild process automation\n\nAn available console build utility simplifies scripting and VS.NET build process integration tasks. Virtual environment configuration is fully programmable via a simple XML specification language.\nLeading Technology Provider\n\nSpoon technology is used by industry-leading educational, entertainment, financial, government, health care, and information technology organizations such as Autodesk, Bank of America, Novell, and the US Army.\nCommerce Enabled\n\nOffer web-based evaluations and online purchases using the available Spoon.net commerce system. Embed launch buttons directly into existing web sites or syndicate on blogs and social networks.\nSupport for All Major Windows Operating Systems\n\nSpoon supports application execution on both 32- and 64-bit versions of all major Windows desktop and server operating system platforms, including Microsoft WindowsÃ‚Â® 8, WindowsÃ‚Â® Server 2012, WindowsÃ‚Â® 7, WindowsÃ‚Â® 7 Server, Windows ServerÃ‚Â® 2008, WindowsÃ‚Â® Vista, Windows ServerÃ‚Â® 2003, and WindowsÃ‚Â® XP.\n\n\n-NO NED INSTALL,IS PORTABLE FULL ACTIVATED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:887a1dbfd206026c9b4dbd1249dcdca8c090a29f","amp;dn":"Studio+Portable+Full+Activated+12+0+340+17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"887a1dbfd206026c9b4dbd1249dcdca8c090a29f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,122,29,191,210,6,2,108,155,77,189,18,73,220,220,168,192,144,162,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
