PDF format.\n\nI uploaded this issue because it has an excellent Keith Francis article on making chamber reamers.\n\nObviously there are other interesting things in these old magazines, in particular I like all the old advertisements.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about making reamers I highly recommend you get a copy of Guy Lautards Machinists Third Bedside Reader, also get a copy of the Machinery's Handbook","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfcac6753edc7a159ac8417b07fe1ef91895d424","amp;dn":"American+Rifleman+Magazine+-+January+1963%2C+Reamer+Making","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfcac6753edc7a159ac8417b07fe1ef91895d424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,202,198,117,62,220,122,21,154,200,65,123,7,254,30,249,24,149,212,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
