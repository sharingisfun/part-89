So that's between 01/01/2013 and 12/31/2013, a mere range of 365 days.\n\nIn fact, there may even be a date indicated in the credits somewhere, but I didn't bother to check. What I am doing, in actual fact, is trying to find out if I can still create and upload a working torrent! This interview, being in the &quot;unimportant&quot; section of my hard drive will serve this purpose quite well, provided anyone is interested in seeing it.\n\nIt takes place in China apparently (aka. Ã¢ËœÂ­ China Ã¢ËœÂ­) one of the least beloved countries on the planet. \n\nMs. Marshall wants to prove otherwise.\n\nActually, I can never sit through an entire Chan Marshall interview and every time I walk away thinking either she's one of the most brilliant actors in history, or simply Satan.\n\nEither way, she writes great songs (or somebody writes great songs that she sings) but that is neither here nor there and irrelevant for my purposes.\n\nHere are the video details for the two videos I scraped and reconstructed from YouTube fragments:\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Caoker meets Cat Power Parts 1/2.avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 170 MiB\nDuration                                 : 10mn 40s\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 225 Kbps\nWriting application                      : MEncoder r33883\nWriting library                          : MPlayer\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7d35141a153d3149534d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 3 frames\nCodec ID                                 : H264\nDuration                                 : 10mn 40s\nBit rate                                 : 2 085 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                                   : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.034\nStream size                              : 159 MiB (94%)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : FF\nDuration                                 : 10mn 40s\nBit rate                                 : 126 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 9.59 MiB (6%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 23 ms (0.70 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 521 ms\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAs you can see, the quality is quite high. And it is visually very clear HDTV range imagery (no significant compression artifacts to be noted).\n\nThe audio quality is typical for YouTube; somewhere between &quot;shitty&quot; and &quot;less shitty&quot;. But in this case, that doesn't matter since it's mostly talking.\n\nThankfully the interviewer never revealed themselves and just let Ms. Marshall kind of drone out continuous &quot;stream-of-consciousness&quot; throughout the whole thing, starring and completing the entire interview by herself.\n\n*************************\n\nDid I mention I love her music?\n\n- 101966","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defec98ffe605c0dfbef3d5dadc61fa3096b1b87","amp;dn":"Caoker+meets+Cat+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defec98ffe605c0dfbef3d5dadc61fa3096b1b87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,254,201,143,254,96,92,13,251,239,61,93,173,198,31,163,9,107,27,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
