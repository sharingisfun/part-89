The press release says: &quot;fully legit and authorised, not a bootleg&quot; which is a lie because I am the audience member who recorded it on a Walkman-Pro and Sony stereo mix on Maxell XLII-S chrome tape on 11/24/83 at Larry's Hideaway in Toronto, Canada. I did not give Ugly Pop Records a copy of my master tape so God only knows how many generations of tape traders have passed this along to produce the hissy mess they are selling. Their own blurb says how bad it is: &quot;WARNING: feeble bastards expecting NOFX CD sound should not order this-- noise not music!&quot; I generously offered them a better re-eq'ed copy from my master tape but they declined to stop their release which was already being pressed and distributed. This sketchy outfit took advantage of retired musicians on a different continent to approve this release, while not bothering to find the person in their own city who made the recording! So here it is - for free - juiced up and sounding like you were there on the night and not listening to a nth gen mp3! If you bought the Toronto '83: In The Cold Night lp please return it as defective. And never trust an Ugly Pop Record again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f1bb08ad1a6d7d1f3edd699291a6307eca7519","amp;dn":"Discharge+Toronto+Larrys+Hideaway+1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f1bb08ad1a6d7d1f3edd699291a6307eca7519","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,241,187,8,173,26,109,125,31,62,221,105,146,145,166,48,126,202,117,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
