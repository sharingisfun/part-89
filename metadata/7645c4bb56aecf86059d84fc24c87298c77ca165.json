This episode's showstopper, though, is a 16th-century silver cup constructed around a carved coconut, complete with handles for greasy fingers.\n\nGlass specialist Andy McConnell puzzles over a vial of smelling salts with a mystery compartment, and Fiona Bruce commiserates with the owner of a collection of ceramic figures advertising a brewery company that met a sorry end after they first appeared on the Roadshow in 1993","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7645c4bb56aecf86059d84fc24c87298c77ca165","amp;dn":"Antiques+Roadshow+S37E22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7645c4bb56aecf86059d84fc24c87298c77ca165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,69,196,187,86,174,207,134,5,157,132,252,36,200,114,152,199,124,161,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
