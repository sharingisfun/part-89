And the age of commercial space travel took off . . . like a rocket. This book chronicles the development of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first commercial manned space program--a program that includes an airborne launcher (the White Knight), a space ship (SpaceShipOne), rocket propulsion, avionics, simulator, and full ground support. With ample illustrations, photographs, and behind-the-scenes information, SpaceShipOne provides a full picture of this classified project--from the conception and design to the deals that brought together Scaled CompositesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Burt Rutan and Virgin AirlinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sir Richard Branson to the plans for building a fleet of commercial suborbital spaceships and launch aircraft.\nThe story of SpaceShipOne combines the adventurous spirit of Charles Lindbergh, the entrepreneurial drive of Howard Hughes, and the urgency of the space race at the height of the Cold War. Author Dan Linehan, who was there at the launch, lets readers in on the drama and details behind the making of spaceships that will take twenty-first-century tourists to the final frontier.\n\nFeatures a never-before-seen cockpit diagram, created especially for this book, identifying all seventy of SpaceShipOneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instruments and controls. \n\nAbout the Author\n\nIn 2004, Dan Linehan attended the launch of SpaceShipOne when it captured the Ansari X Prize.
