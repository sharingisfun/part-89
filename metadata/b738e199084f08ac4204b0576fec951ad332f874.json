It begins in the year 1000 and ends in 1500 after Columbus is known to have reached the New World. Each chapter covers a century and charts the concurrent developments - in politics, religion, warfare, exploration, technology and, chiefly, material culture - that occurred in the known parts of the globe during those hundred years. While the author lays emphasis on the arts and architecture, he outlines the historical background to each century, introducing the major events and the social and political forces which may have been instrumental in shaping the cultures of the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b738e199084f08ac4204b0576fec951ad332f874","amp;dn":"The+atlas+of+medieval+man+%28History+Arts+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b738e199084f08ac4204b0576fec951ad332f874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,56,225,153,8,79,8,172,66,4,176,87,111,236,149,26,211,50,248,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
