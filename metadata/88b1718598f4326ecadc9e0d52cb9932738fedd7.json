The group consists of guitarist Daniel Oreskovic, bassist Alison Kerjean, drummer Cameron Brennan, and visual artist Martin Wong. They have been compared to artists such as Mogwai, Sigur Ros, ISIS and Cog. \nDescribed by the press as Ã¢â‚¬Å“forward-thinkingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Drum Media), and Ã¢â‚¬Å“epic, symphonic and melodicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Triple J), Meniscus seamlessly blend together elements of Guitar-driven ambient soundscapes, hard-rock, electronic and psychedelic music. \n\nOriginally starting out as a three-piece in 2005, Meniscus have since expanded their live show to include video projections, mixed live by Martin Wong, and have released two records: Absence of I EP (2007) and War of Currents (2010). Both records have been well received by both fans and the media alike, the latter describing War of Currents as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a multi-layered and staggeringly moving collection of songsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Drum Media)\n\nReleased in 2011\nSongs / Tracks Listing \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã‚Â  \n1.\tRoom 3327 (04:57)\t\t\n2.\t130 (06:38) \t\t\n3.\tImmersion (08:29) \t\t\n4.\tFight Club (05:04) \t\t\n5.\tCursed (04:31) \t\t\n6.\tInfant (08:26) \t\t\n\nLine-up / Musicians \n- Daniel Oreskovic / pure sonic frequencies\n- Alison Kerjean / low carrier frequencies\n- Duncan Wilson / drum like membrane\n\nCover :\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRatings:\nSputnik Music : 4.5/5\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      ^v notes\nBeautiful work by Meniscus as always.
