The Queen of the Tearling [The Queen of the Tearling, #1] - Erika Johansen\n\nAn untested young princess must claim her throne, learn to become a queen, and combat a malevolent sorceress in an epic battle between light and darkness in this spectacular debutÃ¢â‚¬â€the first novel in a trilogy.\n\nYoung Kelsea Raleigh was raised in hiding after the death of her mother, Queen Elyssa, far from the intrigues of the royal Keep and in the care of two devoted servants who pledged their lives to protect her. Growing up in a cottage deep in the woods, Kelsea knows little of her kingdom's haunted past . . . or that its fate will soon rest in her hands.\n\nLong ago, Kelsea's forefathers sailed away from a decaying world to establish a new land free of modern technology. Three hundred years later, this feudal society has divided into three fearful nations who pay duties to a fourth: the powerful Mortmesne, ruled by the cunning Red Queen. Now, on Kelsea's nineteenth birthday, the tattered remnants of the Queen's GuardÃ¢â‚¬â€loyal soldiers who protect the throneÃ¢â‚¬â€have appeared to escort the princess on a perilous journey to the capital to ascend to her rightful place as the new Queen of the Tearling.\n\nThough born of royal blood and in possession of the Tear sapphire, a jewel of immense power and magic, Kelsea has never felt more uncertain of her ability to rule. But the shocking evil she discovers in the heart of her realm will precipitate an act of immense daring, throwing the entire kingdom into turmoilÃ¢â‚¬â€and unleashing the Red Queen's vengeance. A cabal of enemies with an array of deadly weapons, from crimson-caped assassins to the darkest blood magic, plots to destroy her. But Kelsea is growing in strength and stealth, her steely resolve earning her loyal allies, including the Queen's Guard, led by the enigmatic Lazarus, and the intriguing outlaw known simply as &quot;the Fetch.&quot;\n\nKelsea's quest to save her kingdom and meet her destiny has only just begun. Riddled with mysteries, betrayals, and treacherous battles, Kelsea's journey is a trial by fire that will either forge a legend . . . or destroy her.\n\n02. The Invasion of the Tearling [The Queen of the Tearling, #2] - Erika Johansen\n\nIn this riveting sequel to the national bestseller The Queen of the Tearling, the evil kingdom of Mortmesne invades the Tearling, with dire consequences for Kelsea and her realm.\n\nWith each passing day, Kelsea Glynn is growing into her new responsibilities as Queen of the Tearling. By stopping the shipments of slaves to the neighboring kingdom of Mortmesne, she crossed the Red Queen, a brutal ruler whose power derives from dark magic, who is sending her fearsome army into the Tearling to take what is hers. And nothing can stop the invasion.\n\nBut as the Mort army draws ever closer, Kelsea develops a mysterious connection to a time before the Crossing, and she finds herself relying on a strange and possibly dangerous ally: a woman named Lily, fighting for her life in a world where being female can feel like a crime. The fate of the Tearling Ã¢â‚¬â€and that of KelseaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own soulÃ¢â‚¬â€may rest with Lily and her story, but Kelsea may not have enough time to find out.\n\nIn this dazzling sequel, Erika Johansen brings back favorite characters, including the Mace and the Red Queen, and introduces unforgettable new players, adding exciting layers to her multidimensional tale of magic, mystery, and a fierce young heroine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca746df50a2a979bd9ff62225427a201504c41a6","amp;dn":"The+Queen+of+Tearling+Series+-+Erika+Johansen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca746df50a2a979bd9ff62225427a201504c41a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,116,109,245,10,42,151,155,217,255,98,34,84,39,162,1,80,76,65,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
