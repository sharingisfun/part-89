It has a huge cast of characters and many far-reaching themes, including the philosophy of history, the place of the individual in history; youth vs. age and death; love and marriage; and the pros and cons of acting in conventional ways. It broke so many previous conventions of the novel that Tolstoy, who called it an historical novel when working on it, said later that &quot;it was not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less an historical chronicle.\n\n\n\nCast:\nLeo Mckern\nSimon Russell Beale\nGerard Murphy\nRichard Johnson\nSean Baker\nNicola Pagett\n\n\n\n\n\nWar And Peace - 01 of 10 - Plots And Stratagems\nWar And Peace - 02 of 10 - Disillusion\nWar And Peace - 03 of 10 - Things Fall Apart\nWar And Peace - 04 of 10 - Spring\nWar And Peace - 05 of 10 - Country Pleasures\nWar And Peace - 06 of 10 - Natasha's Crucible\nWar And Peace - 07 of 10 - The Old World Lost\nWar And Peace - 08 of 10 - Borodino\nWar And Peace - 09 of 10 - At The Gates Of Moscow\nWar And Peace - 10 of 10 - The World Transformed\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 55mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a4e353952940b6b665d1ce22c5d26a3daab862c","amp;dn":"Leo+Tolstoy+-+War+And+Peace+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a4e353952940b6b665d1ce22c5d26a3daab862c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,78,53,57,82,148,11,107,102,93,28,226,44,93,38,163,218,171,134,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
