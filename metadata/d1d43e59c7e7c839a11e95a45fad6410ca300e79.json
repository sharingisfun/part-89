Read the review below. The 1986 in the torrent title is the CD release date not the concert dates. These are much older recordings and are a mish mash. Also, thre is a remastered version of this release floating around. This one is the original CD release and fairly raw like you'd expect to hear it played back in the day.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\nBy clio\n\n[quote]Right: This album is &quot;obviously not a real concert&quot; - it's obviously culled from assorted 1966 concerts (plus a couple of studio busks), with all the uneven sound quality you'd expect under the circumstances. So is there something wrong with that?!?\n\nAs a matter of fact ... there's plenty wrong with that (and the album title is fair warning, so don't blame the Stones!). Live roots rock in the 1960s was a riot of frenetic every-man-for-himself energy - the musicians couldn't hear a dratted thing up there - and the Rolling Stones were fantastic at it. This great little album gives us a hilarious, roughshod, whoa-nelly taste of what they sounded like just getting off the launch-pad.\n\nIf you love the Stones, and/or know first-hand what playing rock &amp; roll live is like, you'll get a great raving kick out of this. If not ... get your ya-ya's out!\nPS In _Rolling With the Stones_ Bill Wyman confirms that a couple of these tracks are studio busks, not in-concert recordings. So what - it all rocks![/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/H4ywfSGghd.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Rolling Stones, The - Got Live If You Want It!
