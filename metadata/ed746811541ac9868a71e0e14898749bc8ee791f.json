Of course, the qualifier &quot;loosely&quot; is important.  While some comics feature verbatim quotes of actual conversations, others feature completely ludicrous events including time travel and mecha combat.  The characters tend to be rather heavily exaggerated versions of their real-life selves, and live lives very much their own.  &quot;Real Life&quot; focuses on humor related to video games, science fiction, and other &quot;geeky&quot; interests.  The characters are known for often breaking the fourth wall.  The comic has also been a major spreader of various memes such as &quot;Fuego,&quot; &quot;ShirtNinja&quot; and &quot;The Game.&quot;\n\nThis torrent collects &quot;Real Life&quot; comics from the strip's debut in 1999 through the end of 2014.  The comics are compiled into a set of CBR files, one for each year","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed746811541ac9868a71e0e14898749bc8ee791f","amp;dn":"Real+Life+%28Web+Comic%29+-+Complete+through+2014+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed746811541ac9868a71e0e14898749bc8ee791f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,116,104,17,84,26,201,134,138,113,224,225,72,152,116,155,200,238,121,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
