It debuted in June 2006 for the summer television season and features talented amateurs or unknown performers of all ages (such as singers, dancers, magicians and comedians) who compete for the advertised top prize of one million dollars. From season three onwards, the winner(s) also got a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip. The results are decided by a TV audience vote.\n\nThe original judging panel consisted of David Hasselhoff, Brandy Norwood, and Piers Morgan. Sharon Osbourne replaced Norwood in season two, and Howie Mandel replaced Hasselhoff in season five. Howard Stern joined the panel in season seven as a replacement for Morgan. Melanie Brown replaced Osbourne in season eight, while Heidi Klum joined as a fourth judge. Regis Philbin was the host in season one, followed by Jerry Springer for two seasons, and Nick Cannon from season four onwards.\n\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:877952b1d713539438d3af24f5237de1ef22db8a","amp;dn":"America%27s+Got+Talent+-+Season+2+%28incomplete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"877952b1d713539438d3af24f5237de1ef22db8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,121,82,177,215,19,83,148,56,211,175,36,245,35,125,225,239,34,219,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
