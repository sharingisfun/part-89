Long split between the worlds of 4/4 and bass music, I proposed that last year's DJ-Kicks mix spelled the end of the divide between his bass-oriented Scuba alias and the techno-driven SCB, and his third Scuba album, Personality, meshes well enough with this idea.\n\nScuba's third album, from 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5d75ce13b6d584263e6bcb32edb9afb76470770","amp;dn":"Scuba+-+Personality+%5BWEB+V0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5d75ce13b6d584263e6bcb32edb9afb76470770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,215,92,225,59,109,88,66,99,230,188,179,46,219,154,251,118,71,7,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
