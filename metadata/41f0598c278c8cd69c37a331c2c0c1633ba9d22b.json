The arguments for the belief are analyzed in the first six chapters and include ontological arguments from Anselm through GÃƒÂ¶del; the cosmological arguments of Aquinas and Leibniz; and arguments from evidence for design and miracles. The next two chapters consider arguments against belief. The last chapter examines Pascalian arguments for and against belief in God. This book is a valuable resource for philosophers of religion and theologians and interests logicians and mathematicians as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f0598c278c8cd69c37a331c2c0c1633ba9d22b","amp;dn":"Jordan+Howard+Sobel+-+Logic+and+Theism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f0598c278c8cd69c37a331c2c0c1633ba9d22b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,240,89,140,39,140,140,214,156,55,163,49,194,192,193,99,59,169,210,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
