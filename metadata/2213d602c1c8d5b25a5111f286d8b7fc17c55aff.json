With its mysterious theme, Paradise Circus by Massive Attack opening each episode the series also utilises a play-out track that fits the atmosphere of the story. \n\nComposer Paul Englishby provides the score for the series with music that can range from darkly menacing soundscapes to elegiac dreaminess. His career spans film, TV, theatre, dance and concert hall. He received an Emmy Award for his adroit jazz score to David Hare's TV production Page Eight (also Ivor Novello Award nominated). He also scored the acclaimed John Hurt, Quentin Crisp drama An Englishman In New York. Film highlights include An Education, Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day and Magicians.\n\nAs a special bonus, the little-known Kasabian track Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack WhistlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (previously only available on the single for Empire) makes its album debut here. Always a favourite with the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s star and producers, it was considered for the opening theme song but they never managed to find a home for it throughout the three series. It is included here at Idris ElbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s request. \n\n1 MASSIVE ATTACK Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paradise CircusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n2 THE FIRST CASE [Paul Englishby]\n3 THE HEAVY Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big Bad WolfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n4 CARNAGE [Paul Englishby]\n5 GIL SCOTT-HERON Ã¢â‚¬Å“Me And The DevilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n6 LUTHER DOES THINGS HIS WAY [Paul Englishby]\n7 KASABIAN Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black WhistlerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n8 JOHN LUTHER [Paul Englishby]\n9 NINA SIMONE Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let Me Be MisunderstoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n10 UNLUCKY YOUNG COUPLE [Paul Englishby]\n11 EMILIANA TORRINI Ã¢â‚¬Å“GunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n12 ATTACK IN THE ATTIC [Paul Englishby]\n13 SUEDE Ã¢â‚¬Å“SheÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n14 THE CHILDREN [Paul Englishby]\n15 JOAN AS POLICE WOMAN Ã¢â‚¬Å“FlashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n16 DOUBLE CROSSED [Paul Englishby]\n17 MARILYN MANSON Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n18 HEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S BEHIND YOU [Paul Englishby]\n19 HANNI EL KHATIB Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Got A ThingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n20 ALICE [Paul Englishby]\n21 GRINDERMAN Ã¢â‚¬Å“Palaces Of MontezumaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n&quot;\n\nBelow is a sample of the encoder output for the CD:\n\nX Lossless Decoder version 20141129 (148.1)\n\nTrack 01\n    Filename :  01 Massive Attack - Paradise Circus.flac\n    Pre-gap length : 00:02:00\n\n    CRC32 hash               : ACC743DC\n    CRC32 hash (skip zero)   : D845654C\n    AccurateRip v1 signature : 04133E21\n    AccurateRip v2 signature : AD442F22\n        -&gt;Accurately ripped (v2, confidence 2/2)\n    Statistics\n        Read error                           : 0\n        Jitter error (maybe fixed)           : 0\n        Retry sector count                   : 0\n        Damaged sector count                 : 0","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2213d602c1c8d5b25a5111f286d8b7fc17c55aff","amp;dn":"Luther+Songs+and+Score+From+Series+1%2C+2+and+3+-+%282013+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2213d602c1c8d5b25a5111f286d8b7fc17c55aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,19,214,2,193,200,213,178,90,81,17,242,134,216,183,252,23,197,90,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
