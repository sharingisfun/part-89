It was produced by Pete Atkin and broadcast in 1995 twice each dayÃ¢â‚¬â€œin the morning and late at nightÃ¢â‚¬â€œon Radio 4. The series comprised 216 episodes, each 12Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14 minutes long, and had a total duration of 46 hours. \n\n\nA 29-hour-long abridged version of the programmes has been issued on CD as part of the BBC Radio Collection.\n\n\n\nExtensions and spin-offs\n\nIn 1999 the BBC and Christopher Lee extended the programme to cover the 20th century: from 1901, where the original series had ended, to the end of the millennium. \n\nIn 2001 another shorter series entitled This Sceptred Isle: Dynasties was produced. This told the stories of the powerful and influential families of Britain and Ireland, including the Godwines, the Despensers and the Churchills. \n\nOver the course of several months in 2005 and 2006 Christopher Lee's This Sceptred Isle: Empire, a 90-part history of the British Empire was broadcast on Radio 4. Each part was 15 minutes long. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis Sceptred Isle \n\nThis Sceptred Isle - Dynasties\n\nThis Sceptred Isle - Empire\n\nThis Sceptred Isle - The 20th Century\n\n\n .\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : This Sceptred Isle - Empire.mp3\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFile size                   : 12.2 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 13mn 18s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Constant\nTotal bitrate               : 128 Kbps\nAlbum                       : This Sceptred Isle - Empire\nAlbum/Performer             : Christopher Lee\nTrack name                  : This Sceptred Isle - Empire - 01 of 90 - No Grand Plan\nTrack position              : 1\nPerformer                   : Christopher Lee\nGenre                       : Speech\nRecorded_Date               : 2005\nComment                     : MP3's Recorded By Slimoo\nALBUM ARTIST                : Christopher Lee\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nDuration (ms)               : 13mn 20s\nBitrate mode                : Constant\nBitrate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 44.1 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nReplayGain_Gain/String      : 0.05 dB\nReplayGain_Peak             : 0.729702\nStream size                 : 12.2 MB (100%)\nMP3Gain, Min/Max            : 143,192\nMP3Gain, Undo               : -002,-002,N","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba1f34e0ff69f41a3c904c9b0891161ce720db8d","amp;dn":"This+Sceptred+Isle+-+Audio+History+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba1f34e0ff69f41a3c904c9b0891161ce720db8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,31,52,224,255,105,244,26,60,144,76,155,8,145,22,28,231,32,219,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
