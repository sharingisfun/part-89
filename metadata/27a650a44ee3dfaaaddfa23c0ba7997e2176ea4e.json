Indeed, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get to \n\nknow some immediately-useful VMM 2012 tricks in building service templates. But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll \n\nalso come to understand how Operations Manager handles monitoring, Service Manager and App \n\nController facilitate self-service, and Orchestrator glues everything together.\n\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re here to pass that 70-246 and get your MCSE: Private Cloud, or just looking \n\nto expand your knowledge, this course isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one to miss.\n\nRelated Area of Expertise:\n\n    Microsoft System Center\n\n\nPrivate Cloud isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so much a technology as a way of thinking. A Private Cloud in \n\noperations might look like a virtual environment. It has all of the same actions, buttons, \n\nand management tools. But it is the way in which you operate that virtual environment that \n\nevolves it into something special, and something far more useful for your datacenter.\n\nThis certification tests not only your virtual skills; it also requires a mile-wide-and-\n\ninch-deep understanding of the entirety of System Center: Operations Manager, Virtual \n\nMachine Manager, Orchestrator, Service Manager, App Controller, and Data Protection \n\nManager.\n\nGreg approaches this course as the second of MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two exams, with the 70-247 being \n\nyour first in line. By starting with the 70-247, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the technology underpinnings \n\nfor a Private Cloud firmly constructed. Greg continues that story in this course by \n\nhelping you actually use the environment you just created.\n\nBut he goes further here than ever before, delivering real-world examples that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll want \n\nto implement immediately. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll leave with a better understanding of how a System Center \n\nPrivate Cloud will greatly enhance IT services like IIS, SQL, and even Remote Desktop \n\nServices.\n\n\n\t\n1. Introduction to System Center, the MCSE: Private Cloud, and the 70-246 Exam (00:26:19)\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to get started with monitoring and operating your System Center Private Cloud. \n\nThis exam is unique in that it tests the entirety of System Center, but without any of the \n\nminutiae of Hyper-V. It's also a direct next-step after the content you discovered in \n\npreparing for the 70-247 exam. Join Greg and learn what to expect in this introductory \n\nNugget.\n\t\n2. Constructing your System Center Private Cloud (00:22:11)\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hear Greg make this statement a lot: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to appreciate System Center until \n\nyou get all its pieces into place.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Doing so is a requirement for this course if you plan \n\non following along at home. Greg runs through an example of why the entirety of System \n\nCenter is a requirement for full Private Cloud automation in this course, and gets you \n\nstarted in prepping for your own experience.\n\t\n3. Managing Cloud Resources: Building Blocks (00:22:45)\nLook around MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s TechNet site or most of the blogs in existence, and all youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll \n\nfind are examples of VMM 2012 service templates that reference web services. Greg wants to \n\nprovide a more real-world solution. So in this Nugget, he explains the building blocks \n\nyouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be integrating to construct a Remote Desktop Services infrastructure that supports \n\nScale Out and Scale In. You saw it here first! In this Nugget, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to deploy \n\nnew applications, deploy VMs/services (applications, SQL, roles, RDS), and manage VM \n\nhardware (CPUs, Dynamic memory).\n\t\n4. Managing Cloud Resources: Service Templates (00:39:49)\nSystem CenterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new best practice in deploying cloud services is constructing them from \n\nbuilding blocks rather than merely deploying from a VM template. VMM 2012 service \n\ntemplates are the final step in performing that assembly. In this Nugget, Greg helps you \n\nthrough a few real-world and immediately-deployable examples in which youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll manage self-\n\nservice, demonstrate application deployment leveraging service templates, and manage \n\napplications.\n\t\n5. Deploying End-to-End Monitoring (00:38:18)\nWith a service template deployed and servicing clients, the next step in monitoring and \n\noperating your System Center Private Cloud involves monitoring with System Center \n\nOperations Manager 2012. In this Nugget, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll deploy agents, discover and deploy network \n\ndevice monitoring, import and configure management packs, and deploy and configure \n\nmonitoring of a heterogeneous virtualization infrastructure.\n\t\n6. Monitoring Servers (00:22:30)\nOperations Manager 2012 is an impressive monitoring solution that follows the service-\n\nmodel approach. With it, you can collect all manner of monitors together into a hierarchy. \n\nWhen anything goes wrong, a top-level light turns red. That warning lets you pinpoint the \n\nspecific issue thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tripped a threshold. But before you can construct that model, you \n\nneed its constituent monitors in place. Greg explains in the next three Nuggets how \n\nservers, the virtualization layer, and networking are managed in OpsMgr. In this Nugget, \n\nyouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll monitor the Operating System Environment (OSE), monitor server applications, manage \n\nOperations Manager alerts, and manage notifications.\n\t\n7. Monitoring the Virtualization Layer (00:24:33)\nPart two in this three-part mini-series on OpsMgrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s constituent components takes a step \n\nout of servers and into your virtualization layer. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn in this Nugget how \n\nOpsMgrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s virtualization layer objects work as you monitor host and guest performance, \n\nmonitor virtual applications, manage Operations Manager alerts, and manage notifications.\n\t\n8. Monitoring Network Devices (00:28:58)\nA third constituent component of OpsMgr monitoring is your network and the network devices \n\nthat exist on that network. These network devices arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily your Windows servers \n\nand desktops, but all the Ã¢â‚¬Å“extraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ equipment thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network-connected: routers, switches, \n\nprinters, etc. Greg concludes his three-part mini-series on OpsMgrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic components with \n\nthis Nugget's look at analyzing network device health, managing Operations Manager alerts, \n\nand managing notifications.\n\t\n9. Monitoring Application Health (00:31:10)\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned up to this point is the farthest that most OpsMgr administrators get. \n\nBut what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned are only the building blocks for OpsMgrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true monitoring \n\npotential. It all starts with monitoring the health of applications and services, across \n\nservers, hypervisors, networks, and everything in between. The art in OpsMgr monitoring is \n\nbuilding a good service model, also known as a Distributed Application Model. Greg will \n\nget you started on that path in this Nugget's whiteboard of Application Performance \n\nManagement (APM), synthetic transactions, and distributed applications.\n\t\n10. Configuring End-to-End Monitoring (00:34:20)\nWith the high-level discussion out of the way, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to begin constructing the \n\ndistributed monitoring that your Private Cloud demands. That monitoring is Ã¢â‚¬Å“distributedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nbecause it spans the breadth and depth of all the resources in your Private Cloud. In this \n\nNugget, Greg dives into working with OpsMgr in configuring overrides, creating synthetic \n\ntransactions, and configuring Outside-In monitoring.\n\t\n11. Configuring Advanced End-to-End Monitoring (00:24:49)\nEnd-to-end monitoring is a big topic. As a result, Greg has broken it into two separate \n\nNuggets. In this second half of configuring end-to-end monitoring, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn more \n\nadvanced OpsMgr topics such as configuring application performance monitoring (APM) and a \n\ndeep dive into creating distributed application models. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never seen monitoring this \n\ncomprehensive before!\n\t\n12. Creating Monitoring Reports and Dashboards (00:15:04)\nThe previous three Nuggets can be a bit brain-frying if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not used to OpsMgrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n\nservice model-based approach. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why this follow-up Nugget concludes this course's \n\nheavy OpsMgr content with an easy look at configuring service-level tracking, reports, and \n\ndashboards. Even the best monitoring accomplishes nothing without the right \n\nvisualizations. Learn to create them in this Nugget.\n\t\n13. Managing Problems and Incidents (00:23:39)\nGreg suggests that the 70-246 exam is Ã¢â‚¬Å“a mile wide and an inch deep.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need too \n\ndeep of a skill set in any particular System Center component, but a broad understanding \n\nof how they all work together. That understanding will help you as Greg shifts topics to \n\nSystem Center Service Manager, starting with this Nugget on the very basics of working \n\nwith SCSM. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to work with problems, work with incidents, and how SCSM will \n\nhelp with root cause analysis/diagnosis.\n\t\n14. Implementing Service Level Management (00:20:02)\nService level management is a topic that spans both OpsMgr and SCSM. OpsMgr SLAs focus on \n\ntechnology, while SCSMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SLAs focus on people. Greg outlines the operations of both in \n\nthis Nugget on implementing service level management for your System Center Private Cloud. \n\nIn it youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover how to define service level objectives (SLOs) and service level \n\nagreements (SLAs), implement SLA management and escalation, maintain SLAs (including \n\nplanning for future growth), and analyze SLAs (reporting).\n\t\n15. Implementing Service Offerings (00:36:26)\nSystem Center Service Manager is best known as a work order tracking system, helping \n\ncoordinate the workflow of distributed IT teams. With a little help from System Center \n\nOrchestrator, SCSM also can automate certain tasks. SCSM Service Offerings are exactly \n\nwhat they might seem: Services IT offers that can be requested by anyone with authority. \n\nGreg has the knowledge to teach you what you need to automate approvals and provisioning \n\nof services when you combine SCSM with SCOrch. Learn in this Nugget how to add a new \n\nservice offering to the service catalog, create a custom workflow using the Service \n\nManager console, and reference Orchestrator workflows in Service Manager.\n\t\n16. Implementing Workflows: Automatic Remediation (00:17:22)\nDig deeper into System Center automation in this Nugget as you learn more about SCO \n\nRunbook automation and the automated remediation of incidents. Greg focuses on real-world \n\nuses of System Center technologies that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be ready to implement immediately in \n\nproduction.\n\t\n17. Implementing Workflows: Capstone (00:33:23)\nCertification prep is a reason for learning with CBT Nuggets, but it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only \n\nreason. Once you pass the 70-246 exam, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be using System Center technologies for much \n\nlonger in production. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why Greg pauses in this Nugget to complete the fully-\n\nautomated Remote Desktop Solution that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been building throughout this video training \n\ncourse. In this capstone Nugget, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll design and build end-to-end automation \n\nincorporating System Center 2012 technologies, specifically adding VMM Scale In and the \n\nautomated delivery of ConfigMgr applications to your RDS environment.\n\t\n18. Managing Compliance and Configuration (00:22:49)\nWhen it comes to a System Center Private Cloud, you can assume the words compliance and \n\nconfiguration probably mean Configuration Manager. While ConfigMgr only makes up a small \n\nportion of the 70-246 exam content, this component is incredibly important to Private \n\nCloud operations. Greg explains in this Nugget how to use what ConfigMgr used to call DCM \n\n(Desired Configuration Management) and now simply terms Compliance. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get experience \n\nwith security and compliance management (includes IT GRC process management pack), as well \n\nas analyze and remediate configuration compliance and analyze data in System Center \n\nAdvisor.\n\t\n19. Managing Updates (00:15:17)\nMicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monthly patches at one point were a big detractor to Hyper-V adoption. Smart \n\nIT pros now know that the monthly patches happen for every hypervisor. Those same IT pros \n\nuse cluster-aware technologies to automatically Live Migrate VMs off hosts prior to their \n\nreboot. VMM offers such automation, and also can automatically redeploy services when \n\nservice template changes need to happen. Join Greg in this Nugget as he explores how to \n\nupdate machine roles in a service template, manage and update applications across multiple \n\nclouds, and manage software updates.\n\t\n20. Implementing Backup and Recovery (00:22:30)\nData Protection Manager might not be the sharpest tool in the System Center portfolio, but \n\nit does offer rudimentary backup and restore capabilities for a low price point. Knowing \n\nhow to use it is a further requirement for the 70-246 exam, even if you might not use it \n\nin production (just yet). Conclude your learning experience with this final Nugget as you \n\nback up/recover product settings, back up/recover the cloud infrastructure, manage backups \n\n(protection groups, storage), and implement business continuity for the cloud.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27a650a44ee3dfaaaddfa23c0ba7997e2176ea4e","amp;dn":"CBT+Nuggets+70-246+-+Monitoring+and+Operating+a+Private+Cloud+wi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27a650a44ee3dfaaaddfa23c0ba7997e2176ea4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,166,80,164,78,227,223,170,173,223,162,60,11,167,153,126,33,118,234,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
