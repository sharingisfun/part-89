Wrede &amp; Caroline Stevermer\n\n\n\nTwo girls contend with sorcery in England's Regency age\n\nSince they were children, cousins Kate and Cecelia have been inseparable.

As Cecelia fights boredom in her small country town, Kate visits London to mingle with the brightest lights of English society.\n\nAt the initiation of a powerful magician into the Royal College of Wizards, Kate finds herself alone with a mysterious witch who offers her a sip from a chocolate pot. When Kate refuses the drink, the chocolate burns through her dress and the witch disappears. It seems that strange forces are convening to destroy a beloved wizard, and only Kate and Cecelia can stop the plot. But for two girls who have to contend with the pressures of choosing dresses and beaux for their debuts, deadly magic is only one of their concerns.\n\n02. The Grand Tour [Cecelia and Kate, #2] - Patricia C. Wrede &amp; Caroline Stevermer\n\n\n\nOn their honeymoons, Kate and Cecelia confront a plot against Europe\n\nOcean voyages do not agree with wizards, and seasickness during the Channel crossing is the price Cecelia must pay for her budding magical skill. As her nausea ebbs, she is comforted by her new husband, James, and the knowledge that at long last they are on their honeymoon. In their company is CeceliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin Kate, newly minted as the Marchioness of Schofield, and her husband, Thomas. The shared journey guarantees the two couples a happy start to married life, if they can survive the perils of the Continent.\n\nIn Calais, a mysterious woman visits Cecelia with a package intended for ThomasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother. Inside is an alabaster flask of noble manufacture, one of the royal artifacts that have been vanishing all over Europe as part of a magical plot against the French crown. This is no simple honeymoon: On their tour of Europe, Kate and Cecelia must save the monarchy from an emperor-in-exile named Napoleon.\n\n03. The Mislaid Magician [Cecelia and Kate, #3] - Patricia C. Wrede &amp; Caroline Stevermer\n\n\n\nNow married with children, Cecelia and Kate must face a threat to the wizarding world\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a decade since Kate and Cecelia foiled NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plot to reclaim the French crown. The cousins now have estates, children, and a place at the height of wizarding society. It is 1828, and though magic remains at the heart of the British Empire, a new power has begun to make itself felt across England: the steam engine. As iron tracks crisscross the countryside, the shaking of the locomotives begins to disrupt the workings of English magic, threatening the very foundations of the Empire.\n\nA foreign wizard on a diplomatic mission to England vanishes, and the Prime Minister sends CeceliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband to investigate. In order to accompany her husband to the north of England, Cecelia leaves her children in KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s care. As Cecelia and James fight for the future of magic, Kate is left with a no less daunting problem: how to care for a gaggle of disobedient, spell-casting tots.\n\n04. Magic Below Stairs - Caroline Stevermer\n\n\n\nYoung Frederick is plucked from an orphanage to be a footboy for a wizard named Lord Schofield in Victorian England. Is his uncanny ability to tie perfect knots and render boots spotless a sign of his own magical talent, or the work of Billy Bly, the brownie who has been secretly watching over him since he was little? No matter, for the wizard has banished all magical creatures from his holdings. But Billy Bly isn?t going anywhere, and when he discovers a curse upon the manor house, it?s up to Frederick and Billy Bly to keep the lord?s new baby safe and rid the Schofield family of the curse forever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc29ec440446c17cc88c8d4a0b755a8a564a40b","amp;dn":"Cecelia+and+Kate+Series+-+Patricia+Wrede","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc29ec440446c17cc88c8d4a0b755a8a564a40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,194,158,196,64,68,108,23,204,136,200,212,160,183,85,168,165,100,164,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
