Open part 1 and all 4 parts will be assembled and will mount as a single image. Open it and read the directions.\nApple Service Diagnostics (ASD) is distributed to Apple Service Providers. The Apple Service Diagnostics application is designed to run both EFI and Mac OS X tests from an external USB hard drive. Apple Service Diagnostics (EFI) runs low-level tests of the hardware directly and does not require Mac OS X, while Apple Service Diagnostics (OS) uses Mac OS X to run tests.\nInstalling Apple Service Diagnostics on a USB hard drive Please refer to the document &quot;Installing ASD on a USB hard drive&quot; included with this release.\nNote: ASD is tested with a custom Mac OS that is supplied in the image. As a test requirement the OS is set up as a root user. DO NOT copy ASD to another OS or some tests will fail. Also running ASD on another OS removes some of the Finder menu items and sets preferences specifically for ASD requirements. It will damage your OS so use the one provided","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e10a94be13e2359adbe099c32c9c819f1f9530","amp;dn":"Apple+Service+Diagnostics+3S159","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e10a94be13e2359adbe099c32c9c819f1f9530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,225,10,148,190,19,226,53,154,219,224,153,195,44,156,129,159,31,149,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
