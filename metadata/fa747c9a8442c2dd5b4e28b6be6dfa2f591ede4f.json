Her mother, Berthe, has been confined to a mental institution by Normande's uncle, the wealthy lawyer Jean-Paul. But Normande, who does not believe her mother is insane, kidnaps her from the institution and brings her home. Also living with them is Normande's sister Pierette, who has asthma and a drug addiction, Normande's boyfriend Bouliane, who is unemployed and in no hurry to find a job, and a strange young magician named Carol she took in after he was kicked out of his home. All of these people depend on Normande in various ways and exploit her; Normande, desperate to be loved, is driven mad by the demands of her parasite family. When she receives an eviction notice stating that the building will be demolished and rebuilt into a restaurant, it all becomes too much for Normande and her mind retreats into fantasy to protect her from the harsh realities.\nGenre: Drama, Fantasy\nRelease date: 30 October 1975 (Canada)\n\n\n\nGen Info\n\nFormat: Matroska\nFile Size: 2.13 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 2 620 Kbps\nDuration: 01:56:38\nSample: Included\nEncoder: prisak\n\n\nVideo Info\n\nContainer: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nEncoding type: 2 Pass TURBO 1ST PASS\nResolution: 1280 X 718 pixels\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\nAudio Info\n\nAudio Language: French\nAudio Codec: AC-3\nBitrate Mode: Constant\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels (Front: L R )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa747c9a8442c2dd5b4e28b6be6dfa2f591ede4f","amp;dn":"%5B%2B18%5D+Normande+%281975%29+HDRip+720p+x264+%5BEng+Sub%5D%5BFrench+AC3+2.0%5D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa747c9a8442c2dd5b4e28b6be6dfa2f591ede4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,116,124,154,132,66,194,221,91,78,40,182,190,109,250,47,89,30,222,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
