Lannon - Falling Inside\n\n\n\nReview:\nNyles Lannon, the guitarist/songwriter for the band Film School, wears many hats, one of which is the n. Lannon moniker, through which he explores a unique take on the singer-songwriter formula. Using things like an 808 drum machine and atypical samples (including smatterings of Persian music), n. Lannon creates an electro singer-songwriter sound thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a quirky take on the style that David Gray purveyed in on records like 1999Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s White Ladder. While n. Lannon isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sentimental in the way that Gray is (youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find no Ã¢â‚¬Å“This YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ here), his ability to take the intimacy and directness of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“guy with an acoustic guitarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ formula and defamiliarize it with unique production and instrumental choices is certainly worth your attention. Lannon wrote, produced and performed 11 songs on Falling Inside, with help from drummers Alex Kemp and Jimmy Haun, and some vocal support on a couple of tracks by Kristin Dyrud and Odessa Chen.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This album covers a lot of ground for me emotionally,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lannon explains to PopMatters. Ã¢â‚¬Å“As I listen now, it really captures the feelings I had before and after the birth of my daughter. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t plan it that way, but when I step back and listen to it, there it is. So many of my songs are about my insecurities: feeling vulnerable, unstable, unable. Then there are songs about her, protecting her, and the quiet, still moments with her in the middle of the night. Sometimes you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even know what an album is about until its done, and now this album will always remind me of her.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nRating 9.8/10\n\nTracklist:\n01.
