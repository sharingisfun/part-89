It was recorded in 1977 but was not released until 1981 due to a recording contract problem.\nOn balance, Los Angeles Times jazz writer Leonard Feather is favorable in his assessment, awarding the album three and a half stars, notwithstanding some ill-advised commercial trimmings:\nRecorded several years ago, inexplicably shelved and now belatedly released, this is neither the ill-advised venture one might fear nor a vital part of musical history. Produced and arranged by the father and son team of Marty and David Paich, it has its moments of superior Vaughan, notably on &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and &quot;Here, There and Everywhere.&quot; What went wrong is mostly the fault of the producers: overdressed arrangements (&quot;Fool on the Hill&quot;); overdubbed background singers of which Vaughan was not even made aware; a tiresome tenor sax and rigid rhythm on &quot;Come Together.&quot; For the most part, though, on the strength of her indomitable musicianship and the inherent virtues of some of the tunes, Vaughan overcomes.[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828afcd04d4694fa006705f89b4fdd5128faafc0","amp;dn":"Sarah+Vaughan+-+Songs+Of+The+Beatles+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828afcd04d4694fa006705f89b4fdd5128faafc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,138,252,208,77,70,148,250,0,103,5,248,155,79,221,81,40,250,175,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
