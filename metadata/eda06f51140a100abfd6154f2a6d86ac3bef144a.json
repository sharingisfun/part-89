Emphasis is placed on the efficient computation of the entire set of PID controllers achieving stability and various performance specifications, which is important for the development of future software design packages, as well as further capabilities such as adaptive PID design and online implementation.\n\n\n\nThe results presented here are timely given the resurgence of interest in PID controllers and will find widespread application, specifically in the development of computationally efficient tools for PID controller design and analysis. Serving as a catalyst to bridge the theory--practice gap in the control field as well as the classical--modern gap, this monograph is an excellent resource for control, electrical, chemical, and mechanical engineers, as well as researchers in the field of PID controllers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda06f51140a100abfd6154f2a6d86ac3bef144a","amp;dn":"PID+Controllers+for+Time+Delay+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda06f51140a100abfd6154f2a6d86ac3bef144a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,160,111,81,20,10,16,10,191,214,21,79,42,109,134,172,59,239,20,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
