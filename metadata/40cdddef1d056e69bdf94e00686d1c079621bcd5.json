Concise text, key point boxes and chapter summaries will help medical students with their all-important exam revision.\n\n\nMore comprehensive, and written at a modern diagnostic level with techniques and surgical treatments, the book retains all the features that have made previous editions so successful: numerous colour illustrations, clear down to earth style, rapid access to information, real-life case studies and invaluable chapter summaries.\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nRonald Marks BSc (Hons), MB, BS(Hons), FRCP, FRCPath, Emeritus Professor, Cardiff, UK \n\nRichard Motley MA, MD, FRCP, Welsh Institute of Dermatology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK \n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40cdddef1d056e69bdf94e00686d1c079621bcd5","amp;dn":"Common+Skin+Diseases+%2818e%29+-+Ronald+Marks%2C+Richard+Motley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40cdddef1d056e69bdf94e00686d1c079621bcd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,205,221,239,29,5,110,105,189,249,78,0,104,109,28,7,150,33,188,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
