As the United States and the Soviet Union race to build their nuclear stockpiles, two extraordinary men are called upon to form an uneasy alliance. Studies in opposites-shadow and light-a Dark Knight and a Man of Steel must overcome their mutual distrust to battle a darkness that threatens humankind. And when the paths of these titans cross, a bold and exciting new chapter of history will be written...and nothing will ever be the same.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\nUnabridged\nRelease Date: May 1, 2013\nApproximate Running Time: 6 Hours","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59b4578c53fd148a8bf60216234c3fc3f1524b42","amp;dn":"DC+Universe+-+Enemies+and+Allies+%28GraphicAudio+128%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59b4578c53fd148a8bf60216234c3fc3f1524b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,180,87,140,83,253,20,138,139,246,2,22,35,76,63,195,241,82,75,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
