We can follow step by step the development and flowering of British painting, and can compare, for example, the work of the English Sir Joshua Reynolds with the Scottish Allan Ramsay. Portrait and landscape, history piece, miniature, watercolour, there is a record of them all. The text is both scholarly and readable and the illustrations include well known examples of British painting and others seldom or never before reproduced between the covers of a book. This is the fifth edition of this work, newly enhanced with colour illustrations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1bc0c969fa6ca868314e7d4ab0590ae2e3d6af","amp;dn":"Painting+in+Britain%2C+1530+to+1790+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1bc0c969fa6ca868314e7d4ab0590ae2e3d6af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,27,192,201,105,250,108,168,104,49,78,125,74,176,89,10,226,227,214,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
