The movie follows guitarist Radek &quot;Fred&quot; Gizynski, who spent the best days of his youth playing metal in various bands and shared stages with future Polish heavy weights like Vader. He gave up music after the birth of his child, only to find out ten years and one divorce later, he has no purpose in life. Fred reforms the band with the help of other veteran musicians and some very young people.
