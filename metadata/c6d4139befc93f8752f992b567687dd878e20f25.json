Geranio\n\n\nPer un amico (&quot;To a Friend&quot;) is the second album from the Italian progressive rock band Premiata Forneria Marconi. Released in 1972 by all the initial members of the group, it is considered their breakthrough album that put them on the map. The album remains popular among progressive rock fans throughout Italy and the group will usually still perform all tracks on the album today. The album, still progressive at heart, additionally borrows influences from a variety of rock genres and subgenres. In an Allmusic review, Per un amico was lauded as a classic within the genre and deemed par to the work of the biggest progressive rock acts of the 1970s. Many of the songs from this album would appear either in their original form or re-recorded with vocals in English on PFM's English-language albums Photos of Ghosts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6d4139befc93f8752f992b567687dd878e20f25","amp;dn":"PREMIATA+FORNERIA+MARCONI+-+Per+Un+Amico+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6d4139befc93f8752f992b567687dd878e20f25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,212,19,155,239,201,63,135,82,249,146,181,103,104,125,216,120,226,15,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
