While reading this work, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be just that. Here are behind-the-book stories and facts about authors, publishing and everything literary that will entertain both casual and serious readers. Among the questions asked and answered:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ When Did Literature Finally Get Sexy?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Is Coffee or Opium Better for Literary Creativity?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Why Are the Best Autobiographies so Embarrassing?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Why Do Some Detectives Use Their Minds and Others Their Fists?\n\nWho knew that bestseller lists and childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books could be the source of intense controversy? Or that even the biggest writers had to scrape by, with odd jobs and inventions like the Mark Twain Self-Pasting Scrapbook?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c8e3273988317a40519bbeae35d07cbe391125","amp;dn":"Literary+Miscellany%3A+Everything+You+Always+Wanted+to+Know+About+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c8e3273988317a40519bbeae35d07cbe391125","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,200,227,39,57,136,49,122,64,81,155,190,174,53,208,124,190,57,17,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
