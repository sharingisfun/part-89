And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. Genesis 11:27,28 And these are births of Terah: Terah hath begotten Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran hath begotten Lot; and Haran dieth in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees. Joshua 24:2 And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods. Genesis 10:8-10 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

SS 3/9/14\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTorah Treasures Revealed - Monday October 25, 2012:\nDan &amp; Brenda Cathcart\nThe Sign of Jonah in the Plagues: Exodus and Revelation\n\nNumbers have significance in scripture and, in this lesson we will look at the significance of the numbers two, three, four, seven, nine and ten. The number two represents difference or division. The number three represents divine completion. The number four represents creation. The number seven represents spiritual completion. The number nine represents judgment. The number ten represents the perfection of divine order; a complete cycle. Matthew 12:39-40 NKJV 39 But He answered and said to them, &quot;An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 &quot;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The Sign of Jonah is the presence of the number three, a certain death situation and a miraculous deliverance. Exodus 10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven. And there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days. (MKJV) Matthew 27:45 And from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. (MKJV) Exodus 12:12 12 'For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. (NKJV) At the end of the tenth plague, God completed His judgment against the gods of Egypt and accomplished the redemption of His people. What is it that sets off the plagues against Egypt? Exodus 5:1-3 NKJV 1 Afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, &quot;Thus says the LORD God of Israel: 'Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.'&quot; 2 And Pharaoh said, &quot;Who is the LORD, that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, nor will I let Israel go.&quot; 3 So they said, &quot;The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go three days' journey into the desert and sacrifice to the LORD our God, lest He fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword.&quot; ...

How was the early Christian movement established and how did they observe laws, feast days and interpret scripture?  As we progress along, many insights are given into early Christian teachings and meanings.\n\nRom 11:7-11, What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded \n(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. \nAnd David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: \nLet their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. \nI say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. \n\n&quot;For to provoke them to Jealousy&quot;, do we see the gentile Christian church 'provoking jealousy' among the Jewish communities today?  Do the modern Christian festivals and customs 'provoke jealousy' in the Jews today? As in the case of Christmas or Easter whose origins are of ancient pagan heritage.  For example, Old English Eastre from Austron is a goddess of fertility and sunrise whose feast was celebrated at the spring equinox (much like today).  Rabbits, eggs, eyc are all fertility symbols of Austron, the goddess of fertility.  but does this Easter celebration conflict with 1Co 5:7,  &quot;Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ, our PASSOVER, is sacrificed for us.&quot;  If Christianity's Easter celebration was to truly honor the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, then why does this celebration not coincide with passover?  Or as simply stated in Mark 7:9, &quot;And he said unto them, 'Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.'&quot;\n\nMuch detail is provided within this presentation to help the Christian community re-think about the true intentions behind the scriptures and many modern deceits which impose, restrict or possibly block our way to eternal truth.  Please take the time to learn of these obstacles, what and/or how Christians should use the scriptures to lead a blessed life to better themselves and the church.  As the '...fullness of the Gentiles has come in', let us effectively prepare for the Messiah's 2nd coming.  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso included are the follwing videos...\nThe Devil by B R Larkin\nThe Warfare of Prayer - Dr Adrian Rogers\nThree That Had A Talk With Jesus\nUnderstanding the Ark of the Covenant - Episode 10 - Paul and the law (HD)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca6cd6ee93f025a4d05f6a92abc348e69a0e2d3","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Victory+Over+Sin+Vol+25+-+Understanding+Torah+Treasures-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca6cd6ee93f025a4d05f6a92abc348e69a0e2d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,166,205,110,233,63,2,90,77,5,246,169,42,188,52,142,105,160,226,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
