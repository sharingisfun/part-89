He grew up on Londolozi Game Reserve in South Africa, a place where man and nature strive for balance, where perils exist alongside wonders. Founded more than eighty years ago as a hunting ground, Londolozi was transformed into a nature reserve beginning in 1973 by VartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father and uncle, visionaries of the restoration movement. But it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a sanctuary for the animals; it was also a place for ravaged land to flourish again and for the human spirit to be restored. When Nelson Mandela was released after twenty-seven years of imprisonment, he came to the reserve to recover.\n\n\nCathedral of the Wild is VartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir of his life in this exquisite and vast refuge. At Londolozi, Varty gained the confidence that emerges from living in Africa. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We came out strong and largely unafraid of life,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“with the full knowledge of its dangers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It was there that young Boyd and his equally adventurous sister learned to track animals, raised leopard and lion cubs, followed their larger-than-life uncle on his many adventures filming wildlife, and became one with the land. Varty survived a harrowing black mamba encounter, a debilitating bout with malaria, even a vicious crocodile attack, but his biggest challenge was a personal crisis of purpose. An intense spiritual quest takes him across the globe and back againÃ¢â‚¬â€to reconnect with nature and Ã¢â‚¬Å“rediscover the track.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nCathedral of the Wild is a story of transformation that inspires a great appreciation for the beauty and order of the natural world. With conviction, hope, and humor, Varty makes a passionate claim for the power of the wild to restore the human spirit.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050185-cathedral-of-the-wild&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050185-cathedral-of-the-wild&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(sb-request)\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f011ed152fae91a80d5724f671d20db7293d41","amp;dn":"Boyd+Varty+-+Cathedral+of+the+Wild%3A+An+African+Journey+Home+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f011ed152fae91a80d5724f671d20db7293d41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,240,17,237,21,47,174,145,168,13,87,36,246,113,210,13,183,41,61,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
