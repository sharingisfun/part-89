Zak Ebrahim was only seven years old when, on November 5th, 1990, his father El-Sayyid Nosair shot and killed the leader of the Jewish Defense League. While in prison, Nosair helped plan the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. In one of his infamous video messages, Osama bin Laden urged the world to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Remember El-Sayyid Nosair.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFor Zak Ebrahim, a childhood amongst terrorism was all he knew. After his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incarceration, his family moved often, and as the perpetual new kid in class, he faced constant teasing and exclusion. Yet, though his radicalized father and uncles modeled fanatical beliefs, to Ebrahim something never felt right. To the shy, awkward boy, something about the hateful feelings just felt unnatural.\n\nIn this book, Ebrahim dispels the myth that terrorism is a foregone conclusion for people trained to hate. Based on his own remarkable journey, he shows that hate is always a choiceÃ¢â‚¬â€but so is tolerance. Though Ebrahim was subjected to a violent, intolerant ideology throughout his childhood, he did not become radicalized. Ebrahim argues that people conditioned to be terrorists are actually well positioned to combat terrorism, because of their ability to bring seemingly incompatible ideologies together in conversation and advocate in the fight for peace. Ebrahim argues that everyone, regardless of their upbringing or circumstances, can learn to tap into their inherent empathy and embrace tolerance over hatred. His original, urgent message is fresh, groundbreaking, and essential to the current discussion about terrorism","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a324c97a2d7a5317958a1dc6e43c1abbf010fa5b","amp;dn":"The+Terrorist%27s+Son+-+A+Story+of+Choice+-+Zak+Ebrahim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a324c97a2d7a5317958a1dc6e43c1abbf010fa5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,36,201,122,45,122,83,23,149,138,29,198,228,60,26,187,240,16,250,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
