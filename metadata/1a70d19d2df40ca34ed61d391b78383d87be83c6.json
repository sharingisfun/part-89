R. Kincaid\n\n\nExcerpt:\n\nA log or stump by the road-side may be, in the imagination of the horse, some great beast about to pounce upon him; but after you take him up to it and let him stand by it a little while, and touch it with his nose, and go through his process of examination, he will not care any thing more about it. And the same principle and process will have the same effect with any other object, however frightful in appearance, in which there is no harm. Take a boy that has been frightened by a false-face or any other object that he could not comprehend at once; but let him take that face or object in his hands and examine it, and he will not care anything more about it. This is a demonstration of the same principle.\n\nWith this introduction to the principles of my theory, I shall next attempt to teach you how to put it into practice, and whatever instructions may follow, you can rely on as having been proven practical by my own experiments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a70d19d2df40ca34ed61d391b78383d87be83c6","amp;dn":"The+Arabian+Art+of+Taming+and+Training+Wild+and+Vicious+Horses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a70d19d2df40ca34ed61d391b78383d87be83c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,112,209,157,45,244,12,163,78,214,29,57,27,120,56,61,135,190,131,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
