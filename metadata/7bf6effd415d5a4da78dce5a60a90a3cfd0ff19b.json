A man regularly credited\nwith twisting the codes of high-octane trance and techno into an\nall-new hybrid, it's a path that's seen him progress from nu-skool\nleader to A-list challenger.\n\nHaving popped his mix-comp cherry with Solarstone's ÃƒÂ¦Pure Trance V3'\nlast year, early summer 2015 sees the young Irish turntable-ist take\nownership of his own mix-comp marque. Incorporating his true\ngrit/hang-tight mixing style with a flair for the sonically\nimaginative, Bryan has branded all the visceral excitement of his\nlabel &amp; sound into the first volume of ÃƒÂ¦This Is Kearnage'.\n\nFor its first throw-down, Kearney has drafted in fellow techno-trance\ninnovator Will Atkinson to share mix-duties. Together the pair\ncollectively chamber 36 sure-shots from the breakneck side of the\npaired genres. In and amongst them are the latest from leading\npropagators like John O'Callaghan, Sean Tyas, Simon Patterson and, of\ncourse, Bryan and Will themselves. Kearnage Recordings' studio\nvanguard are also standing tall, with exclusives signed right off the\nmixing desks of Will Rees, Nick Callaghan, Warren Adam, Sam Jones,\nJames Rigby, Davey Asprey and others.\n\nUnadulterated Kearnage from first beat through last, this is the\nmusic your parents' warned you about! Enter Kearnage's arena from\ntoday!\n\nUnder the hood of Bryan's disc, there's plenty of production star\nwattage ready to roar. ÃƒÂ¦Adelphos' and ÃƒÂ¦Stay With Me' - John\nO'Callaghan's latest respective instrumental &amp; vocal spot rockers\narrive quick to his mix. As do Sean Tyas' ÃƒÂ¦Da Doo Da Dah' and Andres\nSanchez's psy-siding remake of Simon Patterson's Beatport-topping\nÃƒÂ¦Whites of Her Eyes'.\n\nNaturally you're in line for an XL shot of Kearney's homegrown too,\nwith the upcoming ÃƒÂ¦Wake Up Call', Will Rees-collab ÃƒÂ¦Prime Example'\nand UCast's rewire of ÃƒÂ¦Awaken' all dealing next-level damage. With\nplenty of Kearnage Recordings' SS15 collection (Sam Jones' ÃƒÂ¦Let\nLoose', ÃƒÂ¦Nethersphere' from Davey Asprey, James Rigby ÃƒÂ¦Anodise' among\nthem), his mix goes above the rim!\n\nAt the peak-of-peak-time, Will Atkinson's mix picks right up where\nBryan's leaves off. He nods in the direction of the sound's\nforefathers, working in tracks from some proto-techno-trance\nproducers. ÃƒÂ¦The Code' - the latest from Mario Piu, Chris Chambers\nhard-grafting rework of DJ Misjah's ÃƒÂ¦No More Mr. Nice Guy' and\nD.A.V.E. The Drummer's immense, intense ÃƒÂ¦Hydrogen' all ramp tone,\ntempo and temperature.\n\nWill's own ÃƒÂ¦Fresh Meat', ÃƒÂ¦Numb The Pain' (ÃƒÂ´9/10 - beautiful enough to\nbring a lump to the throatÃƒÂ¶ declared DJ Mag!), the 2015 edit of ÃƒÂ¦Game\nOver' and his new Darkboy guised ÃƒÂ¦Walk The Talk' collectively send\nthe last remaining rafters flying.\n\n[ SiTES ]\n\nIf you don't know, you probably shouldn't anyway...\n\n[ REGARDS ]\n\n2DB * AAF * AMOK * APC * BPM * DS * EGO * EiTheLMP3 * iDC * JUST\n         KSi * MTC * SND * MiL * MOD * NBD * NmE * NUHS\n                  PULSE * RNS * REV * UTE * WLM\n                   oDDiTy * DeMoN * Razor 1911\n       Superior Art Creations * Chemical Reaction Project\n      ...and all others who make the mp3-scene a better place\n\n[ CONTACT ]\n\nAre you a promoripper/supplier or a DJ?... apply now!\n\nplease contact us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;582f392035286b18302d2b30763b3735&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nNfo Header + Layout by Ferrex of Superior Art Creations\n\nCreated with Nf0 prepare v2.18, by: _Ntr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bf6effd415d5a4da78dce5a60a90a3cfd0ff19b","amp;dn":"VA-This_Is_Kearnage_Vol_1_%28Mixed_By_Bryan_Kearney_And_Will_Atkin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bf6effd415d5a4da78dce5a60a90a3cfd0ff19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,246,239,253,65,93,90,77,167,141,206,90,96,169,10,60,253,15,241,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
