Wind and rain, wear and tear, oil and smoke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all have a huge impact on the appearance of things. This is something we need to replicate on our models, whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re locomotives, buildings, coaches or wagons.\n\nEffective weathering enhances models and helps them integrate with the layout as a whole. It also allows you to add a welcome touch of individuality, setting your models apart from each other and bringing out their different characters. There are many ways of weathering a model, but the subtlest results undoubtedly come from using a quality airbrush and, most importantly, your powers of observation.\n\nEditor for seven years of the influential finescale magazine Model Railway Journal, Tim Shackleton has written close to 100 articles on a variety of modelling subjects and gives regular hands-on tutorials on the art of weathering. In this Right Track presentation he explains step by step how he goes about weathering models, from basic airbrushing to the final titillation with paint and weathering powders. He shows models in a variety of conditions, from a gleaming Ã¢â‚¬ËœBritanniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to an utterly filthy WD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of them based as closely as possible on prototype observation and archive photographs.\n\nIf ever youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve wondered how to add that final touch of realism to your models, this DVD will show you how . . .\n\nContents of the DVD\n\n \n\n Introduction\n Equipment\n Using the Air Brush\n A hard-Working Engine (Bachmann LMS Crab)\n An Elderly Diesel (FIA Trains Ex-LMS 10001)\n Clean... but not Perfect (Bachmann / NRM Deltic)\n Extreme Weathering (WD 2-8-0)\n Brushes, Paints and Powders\n Coaching Stock\n Spit and Polish (Hornby Britannia)\n Freight Stock\n Weathering Buildings \n\nImportant: Resolution = 768 x 576.
