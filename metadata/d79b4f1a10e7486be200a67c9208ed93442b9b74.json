I would say we take something from Pink Floyd, Supertramp, Alan Parsons Project, and even King Crimson and Black Sabbath. But we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play their music, we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make music like theirsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, we just play what we like and how we like. Our music is our feeling. \n\nWe were making this album last three years. We are not professional musicians, but music is a part of our life. \n\nWe are four: \nVladislav Semenov Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keys and vocals, \nAlexander Golenskiy- guitar, \nYuriy Venchagov- bass, back-vocals, \nDmitriy Stepanenko Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums. \n\nIf you like our music, please support us by buying LOSSLESS album on\n\nMore information can be found at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.auxford.ru&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.auxford.ru&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI wish you good listening!\n\nBest regards, \nVlad.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79b4f1a10e7486be200a67c9208ed93442b9b74","amp;dn":"Auxford+-+Reflection+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79b4f1a10e7486be200a67c9208ed93442b9b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,155,79,26,16,231,72,107,226,0,166,124,146,8,237,147,68,43,155,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
