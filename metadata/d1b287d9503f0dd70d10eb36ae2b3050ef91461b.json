A PC disk containing software for numerical analyses by the Monte Carlo method is included to provide hands-on practice in analyzing actual radiative heat transfer problems.\nAdvances in Heat Transfer is designed to fill the information gap between regularly scheduled journals and university level textbooks by providing in-depth review articles over a broader scope than journals or texts usually allow. \n\nKey Features\n* Offers solution methods for integro-differential formulation to help avoid difficulties\n* Includes a computer disk for numerical analyses by PC\n* Discusses energy absorption by gas and scattering effects by particles\n* Treats non-gray radiative gases\n* Provides example problems for direct applications in energy, space, and geo-environmental engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1b287d9503f0dd70d10eb36ae2b3050ef91461b","amp;dn":"Radiative+Heat+Transfer+by+the+Monte+Carlo+Method","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1b287d9503f0dd70d10eb36ae2b3050ef91461b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,178,135,217,80,63,13,215,13,16,235,54,174,43,48,80,239,145,70,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
