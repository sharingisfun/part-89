Dominic Frontiere, who had provided scores for Twelve O'Clock High and The Outer Limits, provided scores for The Invaders as well. The series was a Quinn Martin Production (Season One was produced in association with the ABC Television Network - or as it was listed in the end credits, &quot;The American Broadcasting Company Television Network&quot;).\n\nAll 43 episodes of The Invaders are here and are the best video versions that I could find on the internet. Also, I have included a video interview of Roy Thinnes plus the full pilot episode of The Invaders (Beachhead), which is about 12 minutes longer than the edited first episode that was actually broadcast by ABC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78094b692151ba1b0883e74fe812a1eee076fbf7","amp;dn":"The+Invaders+TV+Series+1967-1968+Complete+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78094b692151ba1b0883e74fe812a1eee076fbf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,9,75,105,33,81,186,27,8,131,231,79,232,18,161,238,224,118,251,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
