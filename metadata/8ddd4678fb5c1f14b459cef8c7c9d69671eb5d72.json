There were many bands that rocked harder (and were more dangerous) than the Sheffield-based quintet, but few others captured the spirit of the times quite as well. Emerging in the late '70s as part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Def Leppard actually owed more to the glam rock and metal of the early '70s, as their sound was equal parts T. Rex, Mott the Hoople, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. By toning down their heavy riffs and emphasizing melody, Def Leppard were poised for crossover success by 1983's Pyromania, and skillfully used the fledgling MTV network to their advantage. The musicians were already blessed with photogenic good looks, but they also crafted a series of innovative, exciting videos that made them into stars. They intended to follow Pyromania quickly but were derailed when their drummer lost an arm in a car accident, the first of many problems that plagued the group's career. They managed to pull through such tragedies, and even expanded their large audience with 1987's blockbuster Hysteria. As the '90s began, mainstream hard rock shifted away from their signature pop-metal and toward edgier, louder bands, yet they maintained a sizable audience into the late '90s and were one of only a handful of '80s metal groups to survive the decade more or less intact. \n\n\nGenre................: Hard Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Mercury\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Pour Some Sugar On Me\n02.Photograph\n03.Love Bites\n04.Let's Get Rocked\n05.Two Steps Behind\n06.Anima\n07.Heaven Is\n08.Rocket\n09.When Love &amp; Hate Collide\n10.Action\n11.Make Love Like A Man\n12.Armageddon It\n13.Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\n14.Rock Of Ages\n15.Hysteria\n16.Bringin' On The Heartbreak\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ddd4678fb5c1f14b459cef8c7c9d69671eb5d72","amp;dn":"Def+Leppard+-+Vault+%28Greatest+Hits+1980-1995%29+%281995%29+%7BFLAC%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ddd4678fb5c1f14b459cef8c7c9d69671eb5d72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,221,70,120,251,92,31,20,180,89,206,248,199,201,214,150,113,235,93,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
