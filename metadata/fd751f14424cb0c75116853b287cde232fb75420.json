Standing (well, ambling) in your way is a never ending horde of the rotting, stinking and stupid undead.\n\nFortunately our mild-mannered hero Bruce can get hold of some tasty weaponry. Burn, batter, shoot, maim, blow up, mince, and obliterate as many zombies as possible before they make Bruce their dinnerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFlaming zombies are faster and more dangerous than regular uncooked zombies. But burning zombies drop better pickups and act as a score multiplier Ã¢â‚¬â€œ light Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem up, score big, and have fun.\n\nKey features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Gamepad Support for true dual stick shooter experience\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ In game Tutorial, prepares you to fight the undead\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A hoard of zombie types Ã¢â‚¬â€œ dancers, exploders, armoured, infectious, and fire-farting super zombies\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An arsenal of weaponry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bats, guns of all sizes, chain saw, flamethrower, lawnmower, brain gun and groovy dance gun\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Big red button Ã¢â‚¬â€œ use weapon combos to enable the big red button and trigger unique level events\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A healthy range of explosives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ upgrade your everyday TNT for increasingly destructive explosives and mines\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A truck load of pick-ups Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ammo, defence for daisy, rampage, speed, time, TNT, and junk food health boosters\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 5 infinite play arenas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Woods, Graveyard, Suburbia, Drive-in, Army Base.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 4 game modes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Free Play, Defend Daisy, Timed, and Survival\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 8 challenges with alternate styles of play\n\nWhat's New:\n\n&quot;Co-op Multiplayer Game ModeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Enhanced for NVIDIA SHIELD Android TV, SHIELD Tablet and SHIELD Portable&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Android TV SupportÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.kavcom.bzb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.kavcom.bzb&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Copy 'uk.co.kavcom.bzb' folder to 'sdcard/Android/obb'\n2.Install APK\n3.Launch the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd751f14424cb0c75116853b287cde232fb75420","amp;dn":"Burn+Zombie+Burn+v2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd751f14424cb0c75116853b287cde232fb75420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,117,31,20,66,76,176,199,81,22,133,59,40,124,222,35,47,183,84,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
