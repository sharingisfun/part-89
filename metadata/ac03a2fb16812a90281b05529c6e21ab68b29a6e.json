The anthology presents the songs in chronological order, from &quot;Vision of Love&quot; (1990) through &quot;Touch My Body&quot; (2008), and is therefore the first compilation to combine Carey's Columbia and Island material. Additionally, there's a new breakup song, the first three-and-a-half minutes of which are an elaborate and mystifying set-up for a display of Carey's whistle range. Given the timing, #1 to Infinity is undoubtedly opportunistic, but it updates and improves upon #1's, a 1998 anthology filled out with four previously unreleased songs that, obviously, were not number ones. Many of Carey's lower-performing but just as significant career highlights, such as &quot;Make It Happen&quot; and &quot;I Still Believe,&quot; can be found on earlier anthologies like Greatest Hits and The Essential Mariah Carey. \n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audio Checker\n\n01.Vision Of Love\n02.Love Takes Time\n03.Someday (MTV Unplugged Version)\n04.I Don't Wanna Cry\n05.Emotions\n06.I'll Be There (MTV Unplugged Version)\n07.Dreamlover\n08.Hero\n09.Fantasy (Bad Boy Fantasy Remix)\n10.One Sweet Day (Feat.
