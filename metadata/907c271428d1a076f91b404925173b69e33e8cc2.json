Dumplings\n\nNigel takes a tour of the diversity in modern British home cooking, starting with bite-sized gems from around the world that make a big impression.\n\nFrom his classic suet dumplings that say old-fashioned Britain, his travels take him to Lincolnshire to meet Nita, whose recipes for pea kachori and lamb samosas have a profound personal significance.\n\nHe meets Rafael from Poland to learn the art of making pierogi, and Liz whose traditional ravioli keeps a little bit of Italy alive for her family in Bedford. As a thank you, Nigel cooks a recipe inspired by them all and invites them to a meal that puts all their dishes on one table","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:907c271428d1a076f91b404925173b69e33e8cc2","amp;dn":"Nigel+Slater-Eating+Together-S01E01-Dumplings-+-WebDL-HD-x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"907c271428d1a076f91b404925173b69e33e8cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,124,39,20,40,209,160,118,249,27,64,73,37,23,59,105,227,62,140,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
