Bush \n\nRobert Scheer's interviews with and profiles of US presidents have shaped journalism history. Scheer developed close journalistic relationships with Presidents Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Bush I. His reporting on them had a tangible impact on national debate, such as the eminent 1976 Playboy interview in which Jimmy Carter, the then-presidential candidate, admitted to have lusted in his heart; and the 1980 interview with the L.A. Times, during which Bush I confessed to Scheer his dream of a &quot;winnable nuclear war.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nIn Playing President, Robert Scheer offers an unparalleled insight into the presidential mind. He analyses each administration since Nixon, and including George W. Bush, offering insights that will surprise the readerÃ¢â‚¬â€particularly those with rigid preconceptions about the decision-making processes of our leaders. The volume will also include reprints of ScheerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous presidential interviews, along with previously unpublished interview transcripts and select previous writings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fa106b5143dc6dad61cd4a3cf1ff0d8f47b5880","amp;dn":"Robert+Scheer+-+Playing+President+%282006%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fa106b5143dc6dad61cd4a3cf1ff0d8f47b5880","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,161,6,181,20,61,198,218,214,28,212,163,207,31,240,216,244,123,88,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
