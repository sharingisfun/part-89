Those homes were never quite finished but the owners have had to move in. So, two years later, Piers is returning to tackle a final set of challenges. With unexpected design dilemmas to solve, all on a shoestring budget, it's now or never as they battle to complete their homes for good.\n\nIn this first episode, pizza van owner Martin from Leeds not only saved money but also improved his building by stepping out of his comfort zone, ditching conventional approaches to the build. But now, he's still got a series of rooms to finish and is at a total loss of what to do. Piers must find a way to rejuvenate Martin's thirst for an incredible home without blowing his budget.\n\nKieran and Piers struggled to get Ruth and Tony to see how important decisions they made on the outside of their home were to it fitting in with the stunning Shropshire landscape. Now, they are facing their biggest and final challenge - to make their modern home blend with the ramshackle collection of buildings that surround it. But will inspiration from one of the country's most stunning contemporary homes be too much for them, and can a solution be found for less than Ã‚Â£200?\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/dgucn8v9Cz.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/Rd1ux9LElJ.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4db379dfd2fe9f0d29c45f98e276808be0e738d","amp;dn":"The+House+That+100k+Built+2015+06+15+The+Final+Fix+Episode+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4db379dfd2fe9f0d29c45f98e276808be0e738d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,219,55,157,253,47,233,240,210,156,69,249,142,39,104,8,190,14,115,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
