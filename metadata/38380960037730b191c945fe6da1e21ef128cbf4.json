Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Robert Baratheon, King of Westeros, asks his old friend Eddard, Lord Stark, to serve as Hand of the King, or highest official. Secretly warned that the previous Hand was assassinated, Eddard accepts in order to investigate further. Meanwhile the Queen's family, the Lannisters, may be hatching a plot to take power. Across the sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family, the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The friction between the houses Stark, Lannister, Baratheon and Targaryen and with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, Tyrell and Martell leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond. \n\n\n\nConsists of 10 episodes of Game of Thrones, season 5.\n\nDonate with BTC: 1BB8gK2jmUXYXc8K6QySb8rF7spso7Rfwc\nDonate with PayPal:\n\nPLEASE SEED :)\n\n\nMain season 5 Cast List:\n    Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister (10 episodes)\n    Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister (7 episodes)\n    Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister (8 episodes)\n    Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen (8 episodes)\n    Kit Harington as Jon Snow (9 episodes)\n    Aidan Gillen as Petyr &quot;Littlefinger&quot; Baelish (6 episodes)\n    Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister (1 episode)\n    Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell (5 episodes)\n    Stephen Dillane as Stannis Baratheon (8 episodes)\n    Liam Cunningham as Davos Seaworth (7 episodes)\n    Carice van Houten as Melisandre (6 episodes)\n    Indira Varma as Ellaria Sand (5 episodes)\n    Conleth Hill as Varys (4 episodes)\n    John Bradley-West as Samwell Tarly (9 episodes)\n\n\t\n\n    Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark (9 episodes)\n    Maisie Williams as Arya Stark (6 episodes)\n    Hannah Murray as Gilly (6 episodes)\n    Jerome Flynn as Bronn (6 episodes)\n    Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy / &quot;Reek&quot; (6 episodes)\n    Michiel Huisman as Daario Naharis (7 episodes)\n    Nathalie Emmanuel as Missandei (7 episodes)\n    Gwendoline Christie as Brienne of Tarth (6 episodes)\n    Kristofer Hivju as Tormund Giantsbane (5 episodes)\n    Michael McElhatton as Roose Bolton (4 episodes)\n    Iwan Rheon as Ramsay Bolton (6 episodes)\n    Tom Wlaschiha as Jaqen H'ghar (6 episodes)\n    Dean-Charles Chapman as Tommen Baratheon (5 episodes)\n    Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont (8 episodes)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38380960037730b191c945fe6da1e21ef128cbf4","amp;dn":"Game+of+Thrones+Season+5+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38380960037730b191c945fe6da1e21ef128cbf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,56,9,96,3,119,48,177,145,201,69,254,109,161,226,30,241,40,203,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
