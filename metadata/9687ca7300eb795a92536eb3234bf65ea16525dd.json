Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nKennedy does her monologue on the 2016 campaign. Chiefly the feathers ruffled by Rand's recent statement claiming that war hawks are responsible for our weapons being in ISIS' hands.\n\nOur fantastic panel tonight consists of PAUL MECURIO, MICHAEL MALICE (!!!), JOANNE NOSUCHINSKY. They discuss the mass of Republican presidential candidates. Next up so called obamaphones moving to so called obamafi. (Dumb nicknames.) Obamafi = &quot;free wifi&quot; by the way. I really don't see that term catching on.\n\nOur exceptionally attractive panel returns to talk about the movie San Andreas and LA's mayor practically going on a press junket and bragging about how the movie could make LA ready for an earthquake. Afterwards they talk about Bill Gates being &quot;over 50%&quot; sure that a terrible epidemic will strike within his lifetime.\n\nCHARLIE LEDUFF stops by to talk about &quot;The Americans with Charlie LeDuff&quot; and the Corridor of Pain. Poverty, crime, and the east coast.\n\nTOPICAL STORM:\nDonald Trump has super secret expert military info on ISIS but wont reveal it.\nLohan finishes up community service or rehab or something.\nTaco Bell &amp; KFC to start delivery service.\nBadger breaks into house, has tasty treat.\nBrothers arrested after having brick fight.\n\nThe panel is back to talk about walking while using your phone and hurting yourself. People are pissed about the movie &quot;Aloha&quot; because of it's terribly offense name. Butthole ruins friend's wedding by purposing at friend's wedding.\n\nRICK DOBLIN stops by to talk about MDMAs theatpeutic effects and and the uphill battle using it to treat PTSD victims. (Which seems to work well.)\n\nTonight's nightcap. The mailbag in which she tells a viewer to eat a bag of dicks. Haha.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.05.28.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 160 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 022 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.150\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1022 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 38.5 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9687ca7300eb795a92536eb3234bf65ea16525dd","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.05.28.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9687ca7300eb795a92536eb3234bf65ea16525dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,135,202,115,0,235,121,90,146,83,110,179,35,75,246,94,161,101,37,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
