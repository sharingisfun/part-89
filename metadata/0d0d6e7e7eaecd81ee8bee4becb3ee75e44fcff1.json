Stingadelics compilation can be\ndescribed as a powerful progressive, consistent high\nquality and massive dance floor potential for the\nupcoming outdoor experiences this summer. In the\nfuture of our career our goal is to keep this quality\nof releases and to continue cooperation with masters of\ntoday's progressive trance. Much love and enjoy the\ngood music.\n\n          We would like to take the\n        opportunity to point out that psytrance\n       needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to\n     give you a preview in psytrance,\n  ambient and electronic music and\n in our opinion this is absolutely\nNO alternative to buying.\n\n MP3 isnt the same as holding a\nbought record in your hands !!\n\nYou need to feel the bass to go with the\nflow ... and that's what mp3 just can't\ngive you.
