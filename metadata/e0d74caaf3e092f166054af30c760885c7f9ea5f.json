Here's our show:\n\nCLIMATE CATASTROPHE VS. CLIMATE CHANGE: Most people think global warming is a big problem. Secretary of State John Kerry said, &quot;It's warning us. It's compelling us to act. When 97 percent of all scientists agree on anything, we need to listen.&quot;\n\nBut &quot;The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels&quot; author Alex Epstein explains that there's a big difference between climate change and climate catastrophe. Even if we have made the world warmer, climate change deaths are at a record low. Fossil fuels save lives.\n\nBLINDLY TRUSTING AUTHORITY: In social contexts, people often ignore reason.\n\n\n\nIf you were asked: which line on the card in my left hand matches the length of the line on the card in myright? Most would say &quot;3.&quot; But it you're in a room of shills who all purposely give the wrong answer, people actually change their answer just because of what others say.\n\nLOOK-ISM? We hear about people being racially biased or sexist, but looks? At ABC, I sent pairs of actors out to apply for the same job with the exact same resume and clothing. The difference was: one was especially good-looking. The other was not. The good-looking people did much better.\n\nRAISE THE WAGE! Higher minimum wage sounds reasonable to most Americans, but it makes no economic sense, and hurts some poor people.\n\nREASON: Twenty years ago, I wasn't so rational. When neither liberal nor conservative publications made much sense to me, I discovered the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason,&quot; which is skeptical of both the left and right. Reason editors Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch (host of &quot;The Independents&quot;) say libertarians are more rational than others.\n\nMY TAKE: Over a third of Americans believe in ghosts. Just as many people believe in astrology. But dozens of studies have debunked astrology! Astrologists tell people things that apply to everyone, and people also have something called confirmation bias: we tend to focus on the things that are true, but forget the dozens of misses. Astrology is fun, but reason is better.\n\n---\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2014.12.11.Be.Reasonable.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 351 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 193 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf54.63.104\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 054 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.121\nStream size                              : 310 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0d74caaf3e092f166054af30c760885c7f9ea5f","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.12.11.Be.Reasonable.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0d74caaf3e092f166054af30c760885c7f9ea5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,215,76,170,243,224,146,241,102,5,74,243,12,118,8,133,199,249,234,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
