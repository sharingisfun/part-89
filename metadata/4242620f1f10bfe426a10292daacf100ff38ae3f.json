This episode follows officers from the North Yorkshire Road Policing Group as they hunt down a gang of thieves responsible for more than 30 violent burglaries on country homes and estates. As the bad weather takes hold, the traffic cops also deal with the aftermath of some life-threatening incidents, from a bad smash on a country crossroad to a lucky escape as a car veers off a bridge into a river 30 feet below. A lorry with toxic chemicals onboard causes mayhem on the A1 when its load catches fire, leaving the traffic cops no choice but to close the motorway during the evening rush hour.\nNarrated by Jamie Theakston.\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nSize: 832x468\nFrameRate: 25.00 fps\nAudioCodec: AAC\nChannels: 2 channels\nSamplingRate: 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4242620f1f10bfe426a10292daacf100ff38ae3f","amp;dn":"Traffic.Cops.s14e01.Rural.Raiders.ENG.SUBS.WEBRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4242620f1f10bfe426a10292daacf100ff38ae3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,66,98,15,31,16,191,228,38,161,2,146,218,172,241,0,255,56,174,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
