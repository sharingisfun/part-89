Disk is version AL, which is dated 2013, but is still the one currently being sold. \n\nDisk was imaged with ImgBurn, see text file for details. Burn with ImgBurn at slowest speed possible with Verbatim DVD+R DL disks and you should have no trouble.\n\nIf you have a unit with version AE or lower you may need to load the firmware update from the AG disk. It seems to improve the units ability to read later versions. There was a change in the disk format from PTP to OTP. Just load the firmware update and then proceed to install the AL. \n\nAG version is uploaded also on PB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:067b06a165431e63a93cdbf7b486e60ea96bef4f","amp;dn":"Jeep+Chrysler+Dodge+Navigation+Disk+AL+-+North+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"067b06a165431e63a93cdbf7b486e60ea96bef4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,123,6,161,101,67,30,99,169,60,219,247,180,134,230,14,169,107,239,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
