While driving on a country road, she hears screams in the back - but there is no one there. When she picks up a woman in the rain, she recognizes her from a dream. She discovers that this woman was the car's previous owner and she's missing. Now her killer might just be stalking Meg as well. Director Gaylene Preston and producer Robin Laing rented out city cinemas, in order to prove this, their first movie had an audience. Preston was quoted as saying &quot;the queues were so long they went right around the corner and around the block, so we'd race down there and help sell the ice creams to speed things up.&quot;\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 704x400, 25.000 fps, 1001 Kbps, 01h22m39s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 169 kbps\n\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/batqof69l/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/batqof69l/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/o9vjrfr09/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/o9vjrfr09/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/cm1hww1vd/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/cm1hww1vd/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/zdakjamwp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/zdakjamwp/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/qgzsfcwah/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/qgzsfcwah/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c102298f42d5ff00aca491ab6203d0750576e0b8","amp;dn":"Dark+of+the+Night+-+aka+Mr.+Wrong+%281986+-+New+Zealand%29+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c102298f42d5ff00aca491ab6203d0750576e0b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,2,41,143,66,213,255,0,172,164,145,171,98,3,208,117,5,118,224,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
