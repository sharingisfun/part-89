However, most of the material here is more along the lines of Fatima Mansion's pulsating dance-rocker &quot;The Loyaliser,&quot; Juno Reactor's &quot;Samurai,&quot; and techno in the form of Traci Lords' &quot;Fallen Angel.&quot; \nWith all of the songs here having appeared elsewhere and the album as a whole having little cohesion, the only fans that might feel compelled to seek out the Virtuosity soundtrack would be Peter Gabriel devotees as his fine collaboration with The Worldbeaters, &quot;Party Man,&quot; is unavailable elsewhere.
