The result is itself exciting: a stimulating study which encourages appreciation of a century rich in artistic talent yet often unduly despised. Without imposing a pattern, the book makes clear the eighteenth century's basic concern with nature and art. It sketches the rise of the Italian Rococo style and the liberal climate which fostered the art of Watteau. The high artifice of Tiepolo and Boucher is appraised, and then the inevitable reaction which set in against their style","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b51d3a0406ef511fe0cc9b85ada4a6177939acd4","amp;dn":"Rococo+to+Revolution+-+Trends+in+XVIII+Century+Painting+%28Art%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b51d3a0406ef511fe0cc9b85ada4a6177939acd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,29,58,4,6,239,81,31,224,204,155,133,173,164,166,23,121,57,172,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
