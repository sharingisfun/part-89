He brings to life the youthful friendships, the bust-ups, the amazing gigs, the terrible gigs, the fantastic highs and the dramatic lows in a hugely compelling, humorous, moving and honest account of life in one of our most treasured and original bands","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d23d719902ae7a3c9f5448aa98c0d3c57f5386c2","amp;dn":"James+Fearnley%2C+Here+Comes+Everybody%3A+The+Story+of+the+Pogues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d23d719902ae7a3c9f5448aa98c0d3c57f5386c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,61,113,153,2,174,122,60,159,84,72,170,152,192,211,197,127,83,134,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
