Ball \nFormat: PDF \nHardcover: 104 pages \nPublisher: SPIE Press (November 19, 2012) \nLanguage: English \nISBN: 978-0819494528 \n\n\nMaxwell's Equations of Electrodynamics: An Explanation is a concise discussion of Maxwell's four equations of electrodynamics - the fundamental theory of electricity, magnetism, and light. It guides readers step-by-step through the vector calculus and development of each equation. Pictures and diagrams illustrate what the equations mean in basic terms. The book not only provides a fundamental description of our universe but also explains how these equations predict the fact that light is better described as &quot;electromagnetic radiation.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ac1fc176ca98ad028631be6ac64297c93ae86e","amp;dn":"Maxwell%27s+Equations+of+Electrodynamics%3A+An+Explanation+%5B2012%5D+%5BP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ac1fc176ca98ad028631be6ac64297c93ae86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,172,31,193,118,202,152,173,2,134,49,190,106,198,66,151,201,58,232,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
