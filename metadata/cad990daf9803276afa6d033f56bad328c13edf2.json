Their music was a blend of pop/rock and R&amp;B -- especially doo wop and smooth uptown soul -- that appealed to listeners across the board, before Motown ever became a crossover phenomenon with white audiences. Even if The Shirelles were not technically the first of their kind, their success was unprecedented, paving the way for legions of imitators; their inviting musical blueprint had an enduring influence not just on their immediate followers, but on future generations of female pop singers, who often updated the style with a more modern sensibility. What was more, they provided some of the earliest hits for important Brill Building songwriters like Gerry Goffin &amp; Carole King, Burt Bacharach &amp; Hal David, and Van McCoy. \n\n\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: VarÃƒÂ¨se Vintage Records\nIncluded.............: Covers, Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.I Met Him On A Sunday (Ronde-Ronde)\n02.Dedicated To The One I Love\n03.Look-A-Here Baby\n04.Tonight's The Night\n05.Will You Love Me Tomorrow\n06.Boys\n07.Mama Said\n08.What A Sweet Thing That Was\n09.A Thing Of The Past\n10.Big John\n11.Baby, It's You\n12.The Things I Want To Hear (Pretty Words)\n13.Soldier Boy\n14.Welcome Home, Baby\n15.Stop The Music\n16.It's Love That Really Counts (In The Long Run)\n17.Everybody Loves A Lover\n18.Foolish Little Girl\n19.Don't Say Goodnight And Mean Goodbye\n20.What Does A Girl Do\n21.Tonight You're Gonna Fall In Love With Me\n22.Sha-La-La\n23.His Lips Get In The Way\n24.Thank You, Baby\n25.Maybe Tonight\n26.Baby It's You (Stereo Mix)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad990daf9803276afa6d033f56bad328c13edf2","amp;dn":"The+Shirelles+-+25+All-Time+Greatest+Hits+%281999%29+%7BFLAC%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad990daf9803276afa6d033f56bad328c13edf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,217,144,218,249,128,50,118,175,166,208,51,245,107,173,50,140,19,237,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
