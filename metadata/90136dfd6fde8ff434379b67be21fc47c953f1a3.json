No one can deny the power of this novel, its hold on the imaginations of entire generations of readers, or the resiliency of its admonitions Ã¢â‚¬â€ a legacy that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90136dfd6fde8ff434379b67be21fc47c953f1a3","amp;dn":"George+Orwell+-+1984+%28Nineteen+Eighty-Four%29+%5B1949%5D+%5BEPUB-MOBI-PD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90136dfd6fde8ff434379b67be21fc47c953f1a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,19,109,253,111,222,143,244,52,55,155,103,190,33,252,71,201,83,241,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
