Rand talks glowingly about Kurdish independence.  He also says that he wants no boots on the ground. Next up they talk about the NSA and Paul's growing anti-surveillance coalition. \n\nTonights panel consists of JIM NORTON, BEN DOMENECH, CARLEY SHIMKUS. The first thing they talk about is Bill Clinton's promise to stop giving speeches if Hillary wins the race.\n\nMONTEL WILLIAMS is here to talk about a bill in Pennsylvania that allows medical marijuana to be provided to seriously ill patients. Montel Williams is a big fan as is Kennedy. Someone they're not a fan of is State Representative Baker who is single handedly stopping this bill from passing.\n\nTOPICAL STORM:\nMassive preggers shark.\nCicadas attack reporter, she quickly freaks out when one lands on her face.\nBaseball man gets mad, starts throwing clothes at other players.\nTornado girl.\nPizza hut to stuff delicious hot dogs inside of crust. Only 3,600 calories per pie.\n\nThe panel returns to talk about nobel prize winning scientist Tim Hunt who recently got in trouble about some not so PC comments made about women in science. Next topic - monkeys (chimps) observed getting drunk off fermented tree sap. In the first 3 months of this year 1336 people denounced their citizenship. High taxes listed as being the primary reason. \n\nBILL BELLAMY here to talk about the 90's, Crystal Pepsi revival, Mike n' Ikes, Coolio, Bill Clinton, Seinfeld's recent comments.\n\nMailbag.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.06.11.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 350 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 160 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 022 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.150\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1022 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 42mn 6s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 38.5 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7799fee50c780ec68607c4114af1eb13a1859052","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.06.11.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7799fee50c780ec68607c4114af1eb13a1859052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,153,254,229,12,120,14,198,134,7,196,17,74,241,235,19,161,133,144,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
