But Mike feels this neglected 1970Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s hatchback is ready for classic status and he enlists Edd to help make this car cool again.

But with a limited budget and some very off-the-wall ideas will this gamble land them a big profit or major loss? \n\nWheeler Dealers Season 12, Episode 5 - AMC Pacer \nAir date: Apr 20, 2015 \nGenre: Documentary, Automobiles, Buy, Sell, Trade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85962cdebb69256cd5b5e2004fbe10ab4cccd23b","amp;dn":"Wheeler+Dealers+S12E05+AMC+Pacer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85962cdebb69256cd5b5e2004fbe10ab4cccd23b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,150,44,222,187,105,37,108,213,181,226,0,79,190,16,171,76,204,210,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
