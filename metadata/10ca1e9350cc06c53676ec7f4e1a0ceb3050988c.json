We'll begin this project by learning about the garbage mask tool. We'll then learn how to easily and quickly control our mask shape and edge feathering using Toxiks powerful Edge Point system. We'll then jump into the basic workflows of animating masks and how we can keep a consistent shape for a more appealing matte. We'll end by outputting our mask into an image sequence that can be used in other applications.\n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n1.Introduction and project overview\n\n2.Drawing masks with the Garbage Mask tool\n\n3.Editing garbage masks\n\n4.Drawing complex masks quickly\n\n5.Creating and using edge points\n\n6.Compositing masks together to create a cutout\n\n7.Animating masks for rotoscoping and changing interpolation\n\n8.Getting the feel of the motion to rough-in keyframes\n\n9.Using Point Consistency to fix edge swimming issues\n\n10.Outputting masks into an image sequence for later use","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10ca1e9350cc06c53676ec7f4e1a0ceb3050988c","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Introduction+to+Rotoscoping+in+Toxik+Tutorial-K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10ca1e9350cc06c53676ec7f4e1a0ceb3050988c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,202,30,147,80,204,6,197,54,118,236,127,78,26,12,235,48,80,152,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
