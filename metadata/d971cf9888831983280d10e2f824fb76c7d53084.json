Their albums have always been a eclectic mix of funk and blues with a large dose of humour thrown in. If anything, this mix has been their downfall as record companies and retailers have struggled to pigeon-hole them.\nThis album, their fifth, is a compilation of their earlier work and a great opportunity to see the range of versatility and musicianship of the group.\nThe highlights for me are the excellent cover of Papa was a Rolling Stone, Out Come the Freaks and the hilarious but musically superb I Feel Better that Jsmes Brown (A tongue in cheek reference to his classic song I Feel Good).\nI bought this album as an introduction to this group a few years ago. I have now collected all their albums. So be warned, once you listen to this album you will want their other work as well. A great introduction. If you want a treat, buy this CD.\nFinally, although Ozzie Osbourne guested with Kim Bassenger on one of their records, Shake Your Head, I have seen no evidence elsewhere to support that he had any other involvement with this Detriot-based group.
