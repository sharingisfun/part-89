As is his habit -- he has purchased hundreds of women -- he asks a madam for her assistance. The fourteen-year-old girl who is procured for him is enchanting, but exhausted as she is from caring for siblings and her job sewing buttons, she can do little but sleep. Yet with this sleeping beauty at his side, it is he who awakens to a romance he has never known.\n\nTender, knowing, and slyly comic, Memories of My Melancholy Whores is an exquisite addition to a master's work.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio; Unabridged MP3CD edition (October 15, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1482939797\nISBN-13: 978-1482939798","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc21a17fa9df5f886909ea21e922e835b6378e65","amp;dn":"Memories+of+My+Melancholy+Whores","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc21a17fa9df5f886909ea21e922e835b6378e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,33,161,127,169,223,95,136,105,9,234,33,233,34,232,53,182,55,142,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
