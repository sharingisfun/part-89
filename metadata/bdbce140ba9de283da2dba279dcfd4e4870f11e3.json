The only objective of the game is to raise hell with your little minions. Unfortunately, the creators of the game decided to stop working on the game in late 2013/early 2014. Because of this, I've decided to upload the latest and last version of the game to TPB to keep the flame going.\n\nJust run the installer to install.\n\nYou can check out the game's old website here: http://wildfireworlds.com/\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdbce140ba9de283da2dba279dcfd4e4870f11e3","amp;dn":"Wildfire+Worlds+Alpha+v0.034+%28Discontinued+Project%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdbce140ba9de283da2dba279dcfd4e4870f11e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,188,225,64,186,157,226,131,218,45,186,39,157,207,212,228,135,15,17,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
