But little does he know his creation gives birth to the next great war: for humanity's free will.\n\nAn e-original story that sets the stage for the BZRK series, BZRK ORIGINS will give Michael Grant's legion of fans the much-desired back story to the founding of the BZRK cell.\n\n02. BZRK [BZRK, #01] - Michael Grant\n\n\n\nLove The Hunger Games? Action-adventure thrillers with a dystopian twist? BZRK (Berserk) by Michael Grant, New York Times best-selling author of the GONE series, ramps up the action and suspense to a whole new level of excitement. Set in the near future, BZRK is the story of a war for control of the human mind. Charles and Benjamin Armstrong, conjoined twins and owners of the Armstrong Fancy Gifts Corporation, have a goal: to turn the world into their vision of utopia. No wars, no conflict, no hunger. And no free will. Opposing them is a guerrilla group of teens, code name BZRK, who are fighting to protect the right to be messed up, to be human. This is no ordinary war, though. Weapons are deployed on the nano-level. The battleground is the human brain. And there are no stalemates here: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s victory . . . or madness. BZRK unfolds with hurricane force around core themes of conspiracy and mystery, insanity and changing realities, engagement and empowerment, and the larger impact of personal choice. Which side would you choose? How far would you go to win? Praise for BZRK: Ã¢â‚¬Å“YA fiction at itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ It's a combination science fiction/adventure/thriller all written brilliantly to entice the reader into a terrifying world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œExaminer.com Ã¢â‚¬Å“Squeamish as I am, Grant has me hooked with the compelling characters that populate the Go BZRK storyworld.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œMichael Anderson, WIRED magazine Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grant utilizes contemporary themes and memorable characters, along with the possibilities of emerging technology to craft aningenious world not too far removed from our own. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ The intelligent presentation will likely appeal to a broad audience.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œPopCultureGuy Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you are anything like me then BZRK will blow your mind. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ BZRK is very different from pretty much any YA book out there at the moment, and the closest I can come to expressing how it is continuing to play on my mind almost two weeks later, is to liken it to William Gibson's Neuromancer which had a similar effect on me many years ago. BZRK is a gamechanger for YA literature.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œThe Book Zone Ã¢â‚¬Å“This novel is full of the intricacies of the human body and non-stop action on all fronts. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ An intricately written science fiction thriller, BZRK offers an in-depthlook into a war raging deep within the human body.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œDeseret News\n\n03.
