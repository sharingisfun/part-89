These early shows played an important role in the group's foundation, as Robertson and Page began injecting their performances with humorous exchanges to hold their audiences' attention between songs. The trick worked, and the band's mixture of comedy and musicianship was cemented. \n\n\nGenre................:Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Vanguard\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Folder.auCDtect\n\n\n\n\n01.Get Back Up\n02.Here Before\n03.Matter Of Time\n04.Duct Tape Heart\n05.Say What You Want\n06.Passcode\n07.Hold My Hand\n08.Narrow Streets\n09.Toe To Toe\n10.Piece Of Cake\n11.Globetrot\n12.Silverball\n13.Tired Of Fighting With You\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c864e50ef809dbec0e10d595b17a682d91bf04fa","amp;dn":"Barenaked+Ladies+-+Silverball+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c864e50ef809dbec0e10d595b17a682d91bf04fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,100,229,14,248,9,219,236,14,16,213,149,177,122,104,45,145,191,4,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
