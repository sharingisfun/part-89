These stories did not make me feel better about the world.\n\nIn a bold, yet completely unintentional move, there is a dearth of Spider-Man material. Just pretend on Earth 1610, real life people are awesome (the United States is lead by President Mister Rogers).\n\nSuch a world would consider the Ultimates comics fiction, because they can't imagine a place where everyone treats one another so shabbily. \n\nNow imagine this world where the I.P. for the Ultimates resides with the Fox Comics Group, who in a licensing tiff with 21st Century Marvel, completely yanks Spider-Man from the publication schedule. An eerie mirror version of events where the Fantastic Four and X-Men are being erased from our own published universe.\n\nOr one can just as easily imagine I just don't collect Ultimate Spider-Anything.\n\n\n\nThis torrent is a repack of digital files from several different sources.
