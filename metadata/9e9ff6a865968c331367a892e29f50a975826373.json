Barnes&quot;]\nThis album is classic, and honestly even though it's not representative of most Chicano rap that you hear nowadays, you can see how Frost set the stage with a couple of tracks, especially &quot;La Raza&quot;. &quot;La Raza&quot; is immortal -- the first of its kind when it comes to Chicano rap. The whole album definitely has a very old-school feel to it, with the voice clips starting many of the tracks. As another reviewer mentioned, he seems to borrow from earlier black rappers. Some of the tracks his flow sounds a little like LL Cool J, because he has a hard and direct delivery, but then again many rappers had a somewhat similar sound at this time.\n\nFavorite Tracks:\n**Ya Estuvo - this one is really cool and pioneering for the time. Kid Frost delivers a rap line by line, first in Spanish then in English.\n**Homicide - Frost shows off his &quot;storytelling&quot; skills in this. He begins, &quot;This is a dramatization.... Homicide, on the murder scene/ another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying/ victim, a young product of the projects/ system, the sad fact is that nobody's gonna miss him&quot;\n**Hispanic Causing Panic - Even though the word Hispanic is like fingernails on a chalkboard to The Sisters Garcia, we recognize that the track was made a time with the word was new and Frost was just trying it out, so we forgive him. This track has a great flavor.\n\nFrost is way ahead of his time. His lyrics and observations are much more astute than the Chicano rap losers that are popular today like &quot;Mr. Capone-E&quot; and &quot;Lil Cuete&quot;, but unfortunately the same can be said for most rap in general. If you'd like to take a trip back to the golden age and see how it all got started, check out this album.\n\nRecommended for: any hip-hop heads[/quote]\n\n[img=&quot;kid frost hispanic causing panic&quot;]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/06/20/Folder.md.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Kid Frost - Hispanic Causing Panic (Virgin 91377)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Kid Frost\nAlbum................: Hispanic Causing Panic (Virgin 91377)\nGenre................: Rap\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1990\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 59 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: somebody on 6/20/2015\nPosted by............: somebody on 6/20/2015\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.m\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size. If you love \nFLAC then you'll know MP3 V0 is your other buddy for going mobile when \nspace and quality are a concern\n\nThe AccurateRip data is embedded in the MP3 tags so you can look at any \ntrack to validate the accuracy of the rip.\n\n- Big Papi\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e9ff6a865968c331367a892e29f50a975826373","amp;dn":"Kid+Frost+-+Hispanic+Causing+Panic+%28Virgin+91377%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e9ff6a865968c331367a892e29f50a975826373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,159,246,168,101,150,140,51,19,103,168,146,226,159,80,169,117,130,99,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
