All characters can act based on their action point (AP). Characters start with a base of 2 AP per turn but can temporarily gain or lose AP based on abilities, spells or items used on them. AP is used on such actions as moving, attacking an enemy, reloading a firearm, or using a spell or item. Any AP that is not used by the end of the player's turn is forfeited.\n\nNot much specific information has been revealed about the plot. The game will take place in 2056. In the Shadowrun universe, there is no government in Hong Kong so the city is entirely run by megacorporations. After the player character moves from Seattle to Hong Kong with the hope of finding work, they find themself caught up in &quot;a corporate conspiracy nearly thirty years in the making.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42e1307434cfd7cfc2a9108e4dfce98ef9c3d352","amp;dn":"Shadowrun+Hong+Kong+%282015%29+PC+%5BNewRelase%5D+R.G.+Freedom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42e1307434cfd7cfc2a9108e4dfce98ef9c3d352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,225,48,116,52,207,215,207,194,169,16,142,77,252,233,142,249,195,211,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
