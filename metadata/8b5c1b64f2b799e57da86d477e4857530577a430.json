He had dear, powerful friends, but he also had terrible enemies. So much so that he has two bullet wounds in his back - each from a different attack. He has also been stabbed repeatedly - always from behind. Lenny, however, is also a warm, grizzly bear of a man, whose main weakness is an overwhelming desire to put the welfare of his mates ahead of his own well-being. In this autobiography he tells of how the mafia flew him to New York to take on their greatest bare-knuckle boxer in a multi-million pound illicit challenge bout. The Mafia's man lasted less than three minutes. When the IRA fronted up a London gang in a money-laundering scam, Lenny was brought in to intimidate the terrorists. The IRA, not surprisingly, backed off. Lenny's most serious trial came when he was accused of murder. Fighting to prove his innocence against a minimum sentence of 25 years, Lenny never gave up, and went on to be found not guilty. After deciding to retire from the violent life, Len turned his hand to acting, debuting in the series &quot;The Knock&quot;. He also had parts in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and &quot;Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b5c1b64f2b799e57da86d477e4857530577a430","amp;dn":"Lenny+McLean%2C+The+Guv%27nor+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b5c1b64f2b799e57da86d477e4857530577a430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,92,27,100,242,183,153,229,125,168,109,71,126,72,87,83,5,119,164,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
