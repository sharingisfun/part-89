It's a gesture only to be topped by his back jacket call-out: &quot;Dear John, Paul, George and Ringo, If I'm a good boy and work real hard, may I please be the 5th Beatle someday?&quot; Born August 4, 1958 in Marlborough, MA, Bobb grew up in the Worcester suburb of Northborough feasting on the Beatles and later Bowie, Pink Floyd, and Queen. The music he went on to create wasn't an attempt to replicate the genius of those artists, but to stand alongside them with his own masterpiece of mythical, hysterical songwriting genius","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bccab5b8cfa898ee6fbb814e1d65eb60c28a305","amp;dn":"Bobb+Trimble+-+1980+-+Iron+Curtain+Innocence+%282007rem%29+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bccab5b8cfa898ee6fbb814e1d65eb60c28a305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,204,171,91,140,250,137,142,230,251,184,20,225,214,94,182,12,40,163,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
