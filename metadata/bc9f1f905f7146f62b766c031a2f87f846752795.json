The sanctuary is thought by many to be just another Old Testament story that is irrelevant today. But in reality it is a detailed picture of the plan of salvation for all of humanity, specifically it shows how God deals with the problem of sin in mankind, and it reveals how we are to come to God to receive forgiveness and cleansing from all sin.\n\n&quot;Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary.&quot; Psalm 77:13\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe 10 Commandments:\nA folder containing 10 short videos discribing the 10 Commandments and their relationship to us today.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSigns - Part 76:\nA folder series compiled of various short clips presenting recent apocalyptic signs occurring around the world today to help us identify the state of affairs ushering the end of days.
