Written for developers with previous experience in any other modern language, this book explains Swift simply and clearly, using relevant examples that solve realistic problems.\n\nAuthor Jacob SchatzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s popular Skip Wilson video tutorials on YouTube have already helped thousands of Apple developers get started with Swift. Now, he helps you take full advantage of SwiftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advanced design, remarkable performance, and streamlined development techniques.\n\nStep-by-step, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll move from basic syntax through advanced features such as closures and genericsÃ¢â‚¬â€œdiscovering helpful tips and tricks along the way. After youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve mastered SwiftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s building blocks and learned about its key innovations, a full section of case studies walks you through building complete apps from scratch.\n\nCompare Swift with Objective-C, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and C\n\nCollect data with arrays and dictionaries, and store it with variables and constants\n\nGroup commonly-used code into functions for easy reuse\n\nStructure your code with enums, structs, and classes\n\nUse generics to get more done with less code\n\nWrite closures to share small blocks of functionality\n\nUse optionals to write more robust, crash-resistant, and cleaner code\n\nIntegrate existing Objective-C code into new Swift apps\n\nProgram on the bit and byte level with advanced operators\n\nImplement efficient design patterns with protocols and delegates\n\nCreate animated 2D games with SpriteKit, and 3D games with SceneKit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8202711060996753e5d0c4236bd57f307e2d0690","amp;dn":"Learning+Swift+Programming+-+Jacob+Schatz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8202711060996753e5d0c4236bd57f307e2d0690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,2,113,16,96,153,103,83,229,208,196,35,107,213,127,48,126,45,6,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
