It can repair 'broken' stereo images which often occur on cassette tapes, vinyl and cheap CD's, which normally causes havoc when playing it on a mono system, headphones or a system which includes a stereo widener.\n\nSpecial support (not free) is included for radio stations: Much louder output levels, FM pre-emphasis, stereo coding and RDS coding for FM stations, and protection of highs against distortion caused by lossy compression for web radio stations. The processing latency can be reduced as low as 12 ms, at the cost of reduced fidelity. At the maximum quality the processing latency is 93 ms.\n\nWinamp plug-in version\nIntended for Winamp, SAM Broadcaster, RadioBOSS, MediaMonkey, AIMP and other applications that support Winamp DSP plug-ins.\n\nStand alone version\nSound card input to sound card output. Intended mainly for FM radio stations which process external (live) feeds.\n\nWhats New\n\nAdded second Multiband Compressor.\nAdded new Dequantizer filter to increase the bit depth of recordings.\nAdded resampler for Normal Output to solve hiccups when using multiple output sound cards or virtual cables.\nAdded auto-restart behavior if buffers get too full or too empty.\nAdded upto 12.5 seconds of audio delay for HD radio.\nAdded support for built-in GUI skins.\nAdded option to show beta version number in title bar.\n\nRDS: Added RT+ support.\nCompressors: Made new Analog compressor design based on behavior of water pressure control systems and hydraulic automatically closing doors. Sounds better and uses far less CPU.\nCompressors: Made new Limiter (only used in combination with new compressor mode).\nCompressors: Made Limit before Compress switchable in all compressor modes.\nAfter-AGC Singleband Compressor: Added new Analog compressor mode with new limiter.\nFinal Singleband Compressor: Added new Analog compressor mode with new limiter.\nMultiband Compressor: Added new Analog compressor mode with new limiter.\nMultiband Compressor: Added Freeze/Gate for all bands combined (Analog mode only).\n\nGUI: Improved display for bigger screens.\nGUI: Increased maximum waveform display from 3.2 to 10 seconds.\nGUI: Made line around Phase Delay in bottom display less bright.\nGUI: Save settings .ini when saving the settings to any file.\nGUI: Improved Compressors gate and limiter display (new Analog mode only).\nSingleband Compressors: Do not allow Threshold values below 0.5 dB.\n\nCPU: Optimized Clipper and GUI.\nCPU: Small overall performance optimizations.\nCPU: Optimized synchronization between sound cards code factor 5 CPU load reduction.\n\nMultipath Clipper: Made it stricter (use Smoothing mode).\nBug fix: Linux 32 bit version is working again in Ubuntu 13/14 (was a compiler optimization bug).\n\nBug fix: RDS: Fixed time zone 30 minute offset problem.\nBug fix: Compressors: When gate is set to -99 dB, release stops working.\nBug fix: Multiband Compressor: Band Link did not work in 3-band mode.\nBug fix: Multiband Compressor: Frequency band shift (10%, since 7.51 or 7.60).\nBug fix: Multiband Compressor: Filtering issue when using Density Drive &gt; 1.00.\nBug fix: Crash when changing certain Stokkemask clipper settings..\nBug fix: Saving FM sound card issue in VST\nBug fix: GUI: Delay of Delossifier in display.\nBug fix: GUI: Load default values question for MB #bands do not ask again did not work.\nBug fix: GUI: Composite clipper used but not registered warning was not shown.\nBug fix: GUI: Threshold and knee were labeled Speeds instead of Levels.\n\nFixed uninitialized memory read warnings (reported by Intel Inspector XE).\nProppFrexx integration: Added RDS control via VST (canDo, vendorSpecific).\nUpdated skins, presets and translation.\n\ninstal the app . close stereo tool/winamp and apply copy/paste crack/serial .\n\nREFUSE CONNECTION OUT FOR STEREO TOOL and for WINAMP SERVICES when first run app\n\n           &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.am/user/degun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.am/user/degun&lt;/a&gt;   Ã‚Â£  N  J  O  Y","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4eaf1114791bbd55a54549342bd12609b4dd012","amp;dn":"Stereo+Tool+Plugin+incl.+crack+REPT+-+DeGun+Pirates-forum.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4eaf1114791bbd55a54549342bd12609b4dd012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,234,241,17,71,145,187,213,90,84,84,147,66,189,18,96,155,77,208,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
