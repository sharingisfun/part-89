The show is hosted by Alan Titchmarsh alongside co-presenters David Domoney, Katie Rushworth and Frances Tophill and sees the team visit locations around the United Kingdom helping people to transform their gardens.\nThis Series is on other sites TPB etc, but for some unknown reason the Scene have it as Series 5, why I do not know. \n\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nThe green-fingered team returns with more surprise garden makeovers for deserving people across the nation. Darren and Lesley Chan's youngest daughter Amelie was born with Charge syndrome - a debilitating genetic condition that has left her deaf, partially sighted and in need of constant care. Alan Titchmarsh sets out to transform the Manchester family's neglected outdoor space, calling in David Domoney, Frances Tophill and Katie Rushworth to introduce sensory planting for the 10-year-old, a shade-loving border and a multifunction pathway made from areas of decking, artificial turf and paving.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nAlan Titchmarsh comes to the aid of a couple who founded a charity to support bereaved families after the loss of their 23-month-old son. Claire and Ian Estick have a busy schedule fundraising and running their organisation, meaning their large L-shaped garden has become a confused mix of children's play equipment, a neglected greenhouse and overgrown shrubs and trees. Alan and the team set about transforming it into four distinct spaces, featuring a kitchen garden and a tranquil seating area, and show viewers how to tackle a towering leylandii hedge.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nAlan Titchmarsh and the team are in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, with the McGinns, whose life was turned upside down when dad Pete was seriously injured in the line of duty as a police officer. In the course of transforming their garden, Alan gives a masterclass in how to achieve a tropical feel using plants that can survive the British winter, and David Domoney tackles an awkward slope with a series of decking terraces and sitting areas linked by boardwalks. Frances Tophill and Katie Rushworth create raised beds full of grasses, and the addition of a hot tub provides the family with somewhere to relax.\n\n4)  Part 4 \nAlan Titchmarsh and his team of green-fingered experts meet a Cambridgeshire mother whose son requires round-the-clock care. Until five years ago, Suzi Sola and her two children Katiya and Isaac enjoyed frequent trips to Spain, but when 12-year-old Isaac was diagnosed with a debilitating condition, these became a thing of the past. Alan wants to lift the family's spirits by transforming their garden into a holiday-themed oasis, drawing inspiration from a man who has recreated a Caribbean beach in his own backyard.\n\n5)  Part 5 \nAlan Titchmarsh heads to Bideford in Devon, where Tamsyn and Alex Wood's lives have been turned upside down in the last three years. Having emigrated to the south of France with their four children, they were forced to return to the UK after Alex suffered a brain injury followed by two haemorrhages. Alan sets his team the challenge of transforming the Woods' garden into a coastal haven, inspired by Alex's passion for surfing and the home's proximity to the sea. David Domoney upcycles a boat to create a bespoke daybed, Katie Rushworth turns old fruit barrels into raised planters and Frances Tophill introduces swathes of hardy flowers mixed in with paths of shingle.\n\n6)  Part 6 \nAlan Titchmarsh and the team are in London, where they transform the run-down garden of Joan Myers, a senior paediatric nurse who has worked tirelessly to help improve the way children are cared for within the NHS - but in doing so, has let her own garden become overgrown. Alan plans to give her a peaceful retreat outside her back door with flavours of Africa and the Caribbean, as well as more than a splash of purple, her favourite colour. He also reflects Joan's community spirit by challenging the team to make over three front gardens, finding different ways of revitalising these tired and forgotten spaces.\n\n7)  Part 7 \nAlan Titchmarsh and the team create a garden for a family with twin girls who have a serious, life-limiting condition. Three-year-olds Darcie and Evie Chapman have been diagnosed with Dravet syndrome, a very rare form of epilepsy, and parents Mark and Natalie must be on permanent watch to prevent their daughters' seizures leading to something more serious. The Chapmans' current outdoor space is unsuitable for the girls, with changes of levels, colours of plants and even the light through branches influencing their condition, so the crew follows the rules of a formal garden where straight lines, order and symmetry give an unfussy overall look.\n\n8)  Part 8 \nThe team comes to the aid of Luke Simpson, who lost his leg in an explosion while deployed in Afghanistan. Rebuilding his life and health with the support of his wife Jackie, the war hero has struggled to make progress on the garden of his dreams. As Alan and the crew work their magic, Frances Tophill reveals the key design elements for a cottage-style plot, Katie Rushworth demonstrates how to make the most out of cut flowers and David Domoney provides hints and tips on maintaining the perfect lawn.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\nclick on the thumbnails below to get full-size images &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/6f511ee32eb8ce9e59118797223f2fd2271d2440.jpg&quot;
