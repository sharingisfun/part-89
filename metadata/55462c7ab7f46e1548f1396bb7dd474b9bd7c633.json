Well here is the Championship Manager 93 Edition,updated with 2012-2013 data. Players like Christiano Ronaldo,Neymar++ are all available.\n\nThere ARE bugs,and the fact that its build on the rather crappy CM93 version,this may not be for you. It would been better to build it on the CM94EOS version imho.\n\nNOTE: You have to load the Savegame. You start of with Liverpool,but you can resign,and add yourself as Manager....\n\nThank you for seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55462c7ab7f46e1548f1396bb7dd474b9bd7c633","amp;dn":"Championship+Manager+1+England+-+2012%2F13+Updated+Data","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55462c7ab7f46e1548f1396bb7dd474b9bd7c633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,70,44,122,183,244,110,21,72,241,57,107,183,221,71,75,155,215,198,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
