Moments that will shatter her tenuous grip on sanity and make her long for the man whose abuse allowed her to function.\n\nAnd when she falls, the berserker is there to catch her. To bring her back. To give her what she needs.\n\nThe zombies are just the beginning. Worse even than the zombies is what comes after--a nightmare witch named Damascus, a horrific decision, and death.\n\nAlways, death.\n\nAs she is given another jagged piece to the puzzle of her past, Rune knows that despite its best attempts, life doesn't have the ability to destroy her--though she offers it all the help it might need.\n\nWith Strad Matheson and the crew behind her, Rune will stride through hell, horror, and the endless, black despair of her own mind to show the monsters why Shiv Crew is the scariest group of warriors they will ever face...\n\nGenre: Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e520c98cb66e5e40476bda066bb472ce0eef9e21","amp;dn":"Laken+Cane+-+Strange+Trouble+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e520c98cb66e5e40476bda066bb472ce0eef9e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,32,201,140,182,110,94,64,71,107,218,6,107,180,114,206,14,239,158,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
