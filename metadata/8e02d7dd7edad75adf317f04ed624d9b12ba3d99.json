All of the songs were new and had never appeared on any previous Ted Nugent album.[1] Nugent explained at the time that about twenty new songs were played at the beginning of the tour, and at the end the best ten were recorded live rather than in the studio later, because they were well-honed from months of performances and had the extra spark of a live setting.[1] It was Ted Nugent's final album for Epic Records.\n\nThe album was ranked at number 9 on Guitar World's list of the &quot;Top 10 Live Albums.&quot;\n\nFLAC\n\nTed Nugent\n\nIntensities In 10 Cities \n\n1981\n\nCD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e02d7dd7edad75adf317f04ed624d9b12ba3d99","amp;dn":"Ted+Nugent+-+Intensities+In+10+Cities+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e02d7dd7edad75adf317f04ed624d9b12ba3d99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,2,215,221,126,218,215,90,223,49,127,4,237,98,77,155,18,186,61,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
