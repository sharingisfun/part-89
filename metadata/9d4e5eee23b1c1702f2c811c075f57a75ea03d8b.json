Paul and Kathy seem to hit it off rather well but, during a meteor storm, a meteorite fragment strikes Paul, burying itself deep in his skull, which has the unpleasant side-effect of causing Paul to mutate into a giant reptilian monster at night and go on murderous rampages. It turns out that this sort of thing has happened before, when Professor Salina rediscovers ancient Native American paintings detailing a similar event many centuries ago. Kathy, however, still loves Paul, and tries to save him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d4e5eee23b1c1702f2c811c075f57a75ea03d8b","amp;dn":"Track+Of+The+Moon+Beast+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d4e5eee23b1c1702f2c811c075f57a75ea03d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,78,94,238,35,177,193,112,47,44,129,28,7,95,87,167,94,160,61,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
