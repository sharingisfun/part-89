Nearly everything about its history remains controversial, but one thing is certain: it left a rich and provocative legacy of political ideas unmatched in Western history. The concepts of liberty, equality, property, human rights and revolution born in those turbulent centuries continue to shape, and to limit, political discourse today. Assessing the work and background of figures such as Machiavelli, Luther, Calvin, Spinoza, the Levellers, Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, Ellen Wood vividly explores the ideas of the canonical thinkers, not as philosophical abstractions but as passionately engaged responses to the social conflicts of their day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93ae59ded5e9334f15924fc2d6f59c5dec0825a","amp;dn":"Ellen+Meiksins+Wood+-+Liberty+and+Property+%282012%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93ae59ded5e9334f15924fc2d6f59c5dec0825a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,58,229,157,237,94,147,52,241,89,36,252,45,111,89,197,222,192,130,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
