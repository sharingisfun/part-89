Catalyst Preparation: Science and Engineering explores the optimization of catalytic materials through traditional and novel methods of catalyst preparation, characterization, and monitoring on laboratory and industrial scales. The book presents many key principles of heterogeneous catalyst preparation and the methods used to synthesize a catalyst with a particular composition and morphology. The first chapters examine the synthesis of bulk materials including amorphous and mesoporous oxide supports, heteropolyacids, and colloidal metals. Subsequent chapters focus on the syntheses of heterogeneous nanoscale materials, including those based on metal complex substrate interactions and those using non-interacting precursors via viscous drying. The final chapters concentrate on pretreatment, drying, and finishing effects before concluding with a prognosis on future applications involving catalyst preparation and the technological advances necessary for continued progress.\n\nAn ideal companion for scientists exploring the preparation of application-specific catalysts based on desired catalytic properties, Catalyst Preparation: Science and Engineering provides a balanced overview of important synthesis parameters to consider for good catalyst design","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:457843173ad69b9703530ea93ad0dd37c052adf1","amp;dn":"Catalyst+Preparation+Science+and+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"457843173ad69b9703530ea93ad0dd37c052adf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,120,67,23,58,214,155,151,3,83,14,169,58,208,221,55,192,82,173,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
