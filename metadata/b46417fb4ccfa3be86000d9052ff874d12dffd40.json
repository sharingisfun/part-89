As such, it provides examples from a wide array of fields where catalyst design has been based on new insights and understanding, presenting such modern and important topics as self-assembly, nature-inspired catalysis, nano-scale architecture of surfaces and theoretical methods. With its inclusion of all the useful and powerful tools for the rational design of catalysts, this is a true &quot;must have&quot; book for every researcher in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b46417fb4ccfa3be86000d9052ff874d12dffd40","amp;dn":"Design+of+Heterogeneous+Catalysts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b46417fb4ccfa3be86000d9052ff874d12dffd40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,100,23,251,76,207,163,190,134,0,13,144,82,255,135,77,18,223,253,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
