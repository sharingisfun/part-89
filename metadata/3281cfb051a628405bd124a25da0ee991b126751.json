ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about fun, breakneck racing and over-the-top crashes.\n\nExpect epic crashes and tight, neck-to-neck fights over the finish line on run-down racing tracks. Expect proper demolition derbies. Expect brand new ways for metal to bend and the signature once-in-the-lifetime moments that can be achieved only with true-to-life physics simulation.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a motorsport, but not just any motorsport. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a motorsport with attitude.\nUnique Racing Experience\nFirst and foremost, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re building a FUN racing game with PERSONALITY. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the stuff that really matters: varied tracks, cool cars, and the defining once-in-the-lifetime moments that can be achieved only with true-to-life physics simulation. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re familiar with our previous games, you already know what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re aiming at: exhilarating racing action with sophisticated physics and damage modeling, only this time weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re upping the ante on almost every front. This is the game we envisioned way back in the early 2000s, only re-imagined for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s technology and gaming standards.\nAwesome Cars\nThe cars are old, cheap, banged up, patched together, rustyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ just awesome! In short, our cars ooze with STYLE. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find anything like them in other racing games. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got variety, as well: everyone loves the old American heavy-hitters from the muscle car era, but weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not neglecting the fun little European and Asian cars from the long-gone decades either. The best part is that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be taking them apart and building them back up again in your garage; the career is as much about your garage and your project cars as it is about racing.\nExciting Engine\nOur in-house ROMU engine is a hell-bent beast that's precision-engineered for high-speed, breakneck racing. We have also already implemented fully deformable soft body car damage, meaning that the cars will react to damage in a very tangible, convincing way. While we're focused on action, motorsport authenticity is not forgotten, either. To that end our engine is simulating vehicle dynamics in a very sophisticated fashion. Rolling resistances, casters and slip angles are definitely not ancient Greek to us, and you as the player will be the one benefiting from our expertise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3281cfb051a628405bd124a25da0ee991b126751","amp;dn":"Next+Car+Game%3A+Wreckfest+v0.189904","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3281cfb051a628405bd124a25da0ee991b126751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,129,207,176,81,166,40,64,91,209,36,162,93,160,238,153,27,18,103,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
