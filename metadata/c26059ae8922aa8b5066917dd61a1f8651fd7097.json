The selection was guided by actual and future demands of applied research and industry, mainly focusing on the efficient use and conversion energy in changing environment. Beside the questions of thermodynamic basics, the book addresses several important issues, such as conceptions, design, operations, fouling and cleaning of heat exchangers. It includes also storage of thermal energy and geothermal energy use, directly or by application of heat pumps. The contributions are thematically grouped in sections and the content of each section is introduced by summarising the main objectives of the encompassed chapters. The book is not necessarily intended to be an elementary source of the knowledge in the area it covers, but rather a mentor while pursuing detailed solutions of specific technical problems which face engineers and technicians engaged in research and development in the fields of heat transfer and heat exchangers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c26059ae8922aa8b5066917dd61a1f8651fd7097","amp;dn":"Heat+Exchangers+-+Basics+Design+Applications+%28InTech%2C+2012%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c26059ae8922aa8b5066917dd61a1f8651fd7097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,96,89,174,137,34,170,139,80,102,145,125,214,26,31,134,81,253,112,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
