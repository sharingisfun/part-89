The group first formed in Sacramento, California during 1988, when then high-school students Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums), and Chino Moreno (vocals) first began to jam together. They chose the name Deftones and began playing out locally shortly thereafter, going through several different bass players before finding a permanent bassist in the form of Chi Cheng. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative-Metal\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Maverick\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, auCDtect Log, Cue\n\n\n\n01.Bored\n02.7 Words\n03.Engine No. 9\n04.My Own Summer (Shove It) (From The Matrix Soundtrack)\n05.Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)\n06.Headup\n07.Digital Bath\n08.RX Queen\n09.Teenager\n10.Change (In The House Of Flies)\n11.Hexagram\n12.Minerva\n13.Hole In The Earth\n14.Cherry Waves\n15.Kimdracula\n16.Diamond Eyes\n17.Sextape\n18.Risk\n19.Leathers\n20.Poltergeist\n21.Entombed\n22.Gauze\n23.Savory\n24.Simple Man\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1d3620655c600e7ae3582acb0b0602ae0e8e190","amp;dn":"Deftones+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1d3620655c600e7ae3582acb0b0602ae0e8e190","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,211,98,6,85,198,0,231,174,53,130,172,176,176,96,42,224,232,225,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
