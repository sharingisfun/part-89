There are four series of exercises, one each focusing on legs, arms, abs, and butt. You can do the entire workout to get a total body experience, or you can focus on one area at a time. Even though each series focuses on a specific part of the body, the use of the ball places constant emphasis on the core muscles throughout the entire program. The ball introduces the element of instability, forcing your deep abdominal muscles and back to maintain a neutral balance. This will give you better posture and more fluid movements. You will increase your physical awareness, heighten your ability to control how your body moves, and enhance your overall balance and grace.\n\nVideo; x264; 708*480 (4:3); 2273 kbps; 29.970 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d487dc6cc757206106b5445a1ce1fa66452dd877","amp;dn":"Target+Specifics+Stability+Ball+with+Katalin+Zamiar+x264+aac+%5BMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d487dc6cc757206106b5445a1ce1fa66452dd877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,135,220,108,199,87,32,97,6,181,68,90,28,225,250,102,69,45,216,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
