Freshman Peggy, an ingÃƒÂ©nue with literary pretensions, falls under the spell of Lee, a blue-blooded poet and professor, and they begin an ill-advised affair that results in an unplanned pregnancy and marriage. The two are mismatched from the startÃ¢â‚¬â€sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a lesbian, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gayÃ¢â‚¬â€but it takes a decade of emotional erosion before Peggy runs off with their three-year-old daughter, leaving their nine-year-old son behind.\n\nWorried that Lee will have her committed for her erratic behavior, Peggy goes underground, adopting an African American persona for her and her daughter. They squat in a house in an African-American settlement, eventually moving to a housing project where no one questions their true racial identities. As Peggy and LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children grow up, they must contend with diverse emotional issues: Byrdie deals with his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compulsive honesty; while Karen struggles with her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liesÃ¢â‚¬â€she knows neither her real age, nor that she is Ã¢â‚¬Å“white,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ nor that she has any other family.\n\nYears later, a minority scholarship lands Karen at the University of Virginia, where Byrdie is in his senior year. Eventually the long lost siblings will meet, setting off a series of misunderstandings and culminating in a comedic finale worthy of Shakespeare","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e410777c2ca6e4a2985feed56e1e5224bc1c8122","amp;dn":"Mislaid+-+Nell+Zink","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e410777c2ca6e4a2985feed56e1e5224bc1c8122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,16,119,124,44,166,228,162,152,95,238,213,110,30,82,36,188,28,129,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
