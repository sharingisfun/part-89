These 'Streamline' edits run shorter because they are\nmissing teasers, cartoons, flashbacks, repetition, history lessons, fun facts,\n&quot;we're experts&quot;, and anything else that slows down the show.\n\nThis is Mythbusters, the way it's meant to be seen.\n\nIf you are wondering why the video quality varies it is because many different\npeople are making these edits over a long period of time. They have similar\nstyles of editing but there are differences in how they edit and what programs\nand source material they use.\n\nAll credit for these edits goes to reddit users listed below.  Postdarwin\ncreated the subreddit /r/smyths and you should go there if you\nwant to find more streamlined episodes.\n\nI have only included the highest quality versions available at the time.\n\nI've also changed the labels on the episodes to conform to the same standard so\nyou can throw them all in a playlist and play them in order","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c359414264a968b1a1ce5d2ec72bb81353d81747","amp;dn":"Streamlined+Mythbusters+Complete+2015-06-27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c359414264a968b1a1ce5d2ec72bb81353d81747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,89,65,66,100,169,104,177,161,206,93,46,199,43,184,19,83,216,23,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
