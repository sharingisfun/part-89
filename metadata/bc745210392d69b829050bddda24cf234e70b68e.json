React.js is designed to make the process of building modular, reusable user interface components simple and intuitive. Here Eve Porcello will help you learn React.js while guiding you through the process of building the interface for a bulletin board app. She reviews components, properties, and states, as well as the foundational parent/child relationships within React.js.
