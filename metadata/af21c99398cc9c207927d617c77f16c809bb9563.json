In this case, Octavia Butler presents the idea of slavery as an alien abduction. Anyanwu is the victim of this allegorical alien abduction as Doro takes her to the United States in the 18th century. The United States is her alien nation. Slavery is therefore like an alien abduction, since the slaves are transported somewhere else and are forced to do things (such as labor) they do not want to do and cannot go back to their native country. Hence, this presents a critique of the African present as well, as it demonstrates the African-American past and how they are living in an alien country, forced to let go of their native country and forced to adopt American customs against their will","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af21c99398cc9c207927d617c77f16c809bb9563","amp;dn":"Octavia+E.+Butler+-+Wild+Seed+%282001%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af21c99398cc9c207927d617c77f16c809bb9563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,33,201,147,152,204,156,32,121,39,214,23,199,127,22,200,9,187,149,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
