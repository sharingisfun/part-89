Vaughan drew equally from bluesmen like Albert King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters and rock &amp; roll players like Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack, as well as the stray jazz guitarist like Kenny Burrell, developing a uniquely eclectic and fiery style that sounded like no other guitarist, regardless of genre. Vaughan bridged the gap between blues and rock like no other artist had since the late '60s. For the next seven years, Stevie Ray was the leading light in American blues, consistently selling out concerts while his albums regularly went gold. His tragic death in 1990 only emphasized his influence in blues and American rock &amp; roll. \n\n\nGenre................: Blues-Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Epic/Legacy\nIncluded.............: Covers, Audio Checker, Log, Cue\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Shake For Me (Live)\n02.Rude MoodHide Away (Live)\n03.Love Struck Baby\n04.Pride And Joy\n05.Texas Flood\n06.Mary Had A Little Lamb\n07.Lenny\n08.Scuttle Buttin'\n09.Couldn't Stand The Weather\n10.The Things (That) I Used To Do\n11.Cold Shot\n12.Tin Pan Alley (aka Roughest Place In Town)\n13.Give Me Back My Wig\n14.Empty Arms\n15.The Sky Is Crying (Live)\n16.Voodoo Child (Slight Return) (Live)\n\nCD2\n\n01.Say What!\n02.Look At Little Sister\n03.Change It\n04.Come On (Part III)\n05.Life Without You\n06.Little Wing\n07.Willie The Wimp (Live)\n08.Superstition (Live)\n09.Leave My Girl Alone (Live)\n10.The House Is Rockin'\n11.Crossfire\n12.Tightrope\n13.Wall Of Denial\n14.Riviera Paradise\n15.Telephone Song (The Vaughan Bros.)\n16.Long Way From Home (The Vaughan Bros.)\n17.Life By The Drop\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8282c0747582e3957e9f54ecd3d180391e9c1ae8","amp;dn":"The+Essential+Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+And+Double+Trouble+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8282c0747582e3957e9f54ecd3d180391e9c1ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,130,192,116,117,130,227,149,126,159,84,236,211,209,128,57,30,156,26,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
