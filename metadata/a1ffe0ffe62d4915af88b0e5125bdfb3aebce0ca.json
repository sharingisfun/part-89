The name would later be shortened to the 101 All Stars and finally just the 101ers. The group played at free festivals such as Stonehenge, and established itself on the London pub rock circuit prior to the advent of punk.\n\n\nOrigin\n \nLondon, UK\n \n\n\nGenres\n \nPub rock, protopunk\n \n\n\nYears active\n \n1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1976, 2003 (tribute concert for Joe)\n \n\n\nLabels\n \nChiswick\n Andalucia\n Astralwerks\n EMI\n \n\n\nAssociated acts\n \nThe Clash\n The Passions\n The Raincoats\n Public Image Ltd\n Basement 5\n The Latino Rockabilly War\n The Pogues\n The Mescaleros","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ffe0ffe62d4915af88b0e5125bdfb3aebce0ca","amp;dn":"The+101+ers+-+Elein+Avenue+Breakdown+-+Revisited+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ffe0ffe62d4915af88b0e5125bdfb3aebce0ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,255,224,255,230,45,73,21,175,136,176,229,18,91,223,179,174,188,224,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
