However, orchestrating multiple clients and keeping everyone in sync with a game server, reducing and managing network latency (all the while preventing cheating), and making sure every player has an excellent experience can quickly become overwhelming.\n\nThis book will teach you how to develop games that support multiple players interacting in the same game world, and show you how to perform network programming operations in order to implement such systems. It covers the fundamentals of game networking by developing a real-time multiplayer game of Tic-tac-toe before moving on to convert an existing 2D single-player snake game to multiplayer, using a more scalable game design for online gaming.\n\nFinally you will be tackling more advanced networking topics, allowing you to handle problems such as server queries from multiple users and making your multiplayer games more secure and less prone to cheating","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9510606f33ab09bd46c73510bdc0b0f6f23ad611","amp;dn":"Multiplayer+Game+Development+with+HTML5+-+Rodrigo+Silveira","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9510606f33ab09bd46c73510bdc0b0f6f23ad611","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,16,96,111,51,171,9,189,70,199,53,16,189,192,176,246,242,58,214,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
