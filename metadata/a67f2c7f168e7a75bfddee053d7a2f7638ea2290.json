Melody Maker called the LP &quot;an astonishing debut by anybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standards,&quot; and indeed it is. The incredible, supple beauty that Galaxie spun like straw was so sweetly melancholic that it all but smothered you. DamonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drums drift with the simmering presence of jazz classicism, NaomiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass is rich with dreamy emotional content, DeanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar completes the aural landscapes begun by Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ69-era Sterling Morrison, and the vocals emerge from the Ouija board of eternity. A highlight of Today is the incredible primal-drone-hunch treatment the band gives to Jonathan RichmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let Our Youth Go to Waste.&quot; The three extra tracks from this session, included on the box set, would have made Sonic YouthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Thurston Moore fiercer in his declaration of Today as &quot;my favorite guitar record of 1988.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a67f2c7f168e7a75bfddee053d7a2f7638ea2290","amp;dn":"Galaxie+500+-+1988+-+Today+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a67f2c7f168e7a75bfddee053d7a2f7638ea2290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,127,44,127,22,142,122,117,191,221,238,5,61,122,47,118,56,234,34,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
