Starting from small, stone outbuildings with straw roofs, the beginnings of English architecture are just as impressive as the gorgeous manor houses and mansions in the later centuries. Not only is the information about the different styles of houses interesting, but it explains why the houses were built the way they were and how they held up through the years. Some of the examples of houses are cottages that look like hobbit houses, while others are sprawling mansions that have acres of landscaped yards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f8fc6f725a75d4e0dc0450f88c691dace705285","amp;dn":"The+English+House+Through+Seven+Centuries+%28Architecture%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f8fc6f725a75d4e0dc0450f88c691dace705285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,143,198,247,37,167,93,78,13,192,69,15,136,198,145,218,206,112,82,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
