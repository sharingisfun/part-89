Loyal, obedient, and affectionate, they are truly Ã¢â‚¬Å“manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But do dogs love us the way we love them? Emory University neuroscientist Gregory Berns had spent decades using MRI imaging technology to study how the human brain works, but a different question still nagged at him: What is my dog thinking?\n \nAfter his family adopted Callie, a shy, skinny terrier mix, Berns decided that there was only one way to answer that questionÃ¢â‚¬â€use an MRI machine to scan the dogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brain. His colleagues dismissed the idea. Everyone knew that dogs needed to be restrained or sedated for MRI scans. But if the military could train dogs to operate calmly in some of the most challenging environments, surely there must be a way to train dogs to sit in an MRI scanner.\n \nWith this radical conviction, Berns and his dog would embark on a remarkable journey and be the first to glimpse the inner workings of the canine brain. Painstakingly, the two worked together to overcome the many technical, legal, and behavioral hurdles. BernsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s research offers surprising results on how dogs empathize with human emotions, how they love us, and why dogs and humans share one of the most remarkable friendships in the animal kingdom.\n \nHow Dogs Love Us answers the age-old question of dog lovers everywhere and offers profound new evidence that dogs should be treated as we would treat our best human friends: with love, respect, and appreciation for their social and emotional intelligence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f9292772184f8c67def25a860af14a66c63215f","amp;dn":"G.+Berns+-+How+Dogs+Love+Us","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f9292772184f8c67def25a860af14a66c63215f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,146,146,119,33,132,248,198,125,239,37,168,96,175,20,166,108,99,33,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
