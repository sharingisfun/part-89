It chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society.\nBased on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it was the final film of Leone's career and the first feature-film he had directed in thirteen years. The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli, and Ennio Morricone provided the film score. It is the final installment in Leone's Once Upon a Time Trilogy, preceded by Once Upon a Time in the West and Once Upon a Time... the Revolution.\n\nThe musical score was composed by Leone's long-time collaborator, Ennio Morricone. Due to the film's long production, Morricone had finished composing most of the soundtrack before many scenes had been filmed. Some of Morricone's pieces were played on set as filming took place, a technique that Leone used for Once Upon a Time in the West. &quot;Deborah's Theme&quot; was written for another film in the 1970s but rejected; Morricone presented the piece to Leone, who was initially reluctant, considering it too similar to Morricone's main title for Once Upon a Time in the West. The score is also notable for MorriconeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incorporation of Gheorghe Zamfir, who plays a pan flute. At times this music is used to convey remembrance, at other times terror. Morricone also collaborated with vocalist Edda Dell'Orso on the score.\nA soundtrack album was released in 1984 by Mercury Records. This was followed by a special edition release in 1995, featuring four additional tracks. (wikipedia.org)\n\n\n\nThis Special Edition is a definate improvement on the original soundtrack release. The music sounds great (remastered) and the extra tracks add layers of intrigue, particularly the Once Upon a Time.. &quot;Suite&quot; which blends the main themes and adds some very arresting suspense motifs. \nThe sleeve notes are really good too, with some fine production stills and a great text about the &quot;making of&quot;. This helps to bring the Leone/ Morricone collaboration to life. \nIf you're a fan of the movie this will enhance your memory of a wonderful film. And if you're a fan of Ennio Morricone then you should definately have this one. Five stars ain't enough!
