This is the David Crosby Masterpiece! Spellbinding and humbling music because when you hear an album like this you realise the difference between pure genius talent and the rest of us! Every single track is between 4 and 5 stars with Hero, Too Young to Die, Old Soldier and Through your Hands being the absolute standouts. Too all of us who survived the suicidal moments of our teens - Too Young to Die is an anthem in rememberance of those wild nights out on the road. &quot;Too fast for comfort, too low to fly, too young...to die&quot; And I ask any parent to attempt to stay dry eyed listening to &quot;Through your Hands&quot; &quot;when you ask, why am I not noticed, I say - Your voice does not command! In time you will move mountains and it will come through your hands...&quot; - this everybody, is celestial songwriting. Columbus Natalie and Coverage are superb and very distinct tracks. The whole album can be listened to as one piece of music again and again and again and again - and again!!!\nI was always a big Steven Stills fan but this album has opened my eyes (and ears) to the genius of David Crosby. To allow him to sign of this review...\n&quot;And I wonder, yes I wonder! How do you make sense of this? When the Hero...Kills the Maiden.. with his Kiss...[/quote]\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/01/1-Scan-150630-0002.md.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n           David Crosby - Thousand Roads (Atlantic 82484)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: David Crosby\nAlbum................: Thousand Roads (Atlantic 82484)\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993 05 04\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 56 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
