Kuppaswamy Iyengar shows you how to get it right the first time, use free energy systems, and utilise technologies that minimize fossil fuel use. Each chapter has a sustainable design overview, technical details and strategies marked by clear sections, a summary, and further resources. Heavily illustrated with charts, tables, drawings, photographs, and case studies, the book shows technologies and concepts integrated into cohesive project types, from small and large office spaces to single and multiuse residences, hospitals, schools, restaurants, and warehouses to demonstrate implementing your designs to meet clients' needs now and for the future.\n\nIncludes an overview of alternate assessment and evaluation systems such as BREEAM, CASBEE, GBTool, Green Globes alongside LEED, ECOTECT, energy 10, HEED and eQuest simulation programs. The guide reveals the importance of the building envelopeÃ¢â‚¬â€¢walls, superstructure, insulation, windows, floors, roofs, and building materialsÃ¢â‚¬â€¢on the environmental impact of a building, and has a section on site systems examining site selection, landscape design, thermal impact, and building placement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945dcaf7fde8191c0366fd84b4f956ba0298e1ef","amp;dn":"Sustainable+Architectural+Design+-+Kuppaswamy+Iyengar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945dcaf7fde8191c0366fd84b4f956ba0298e1ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,93,202,247,253,232,25,28,3,102,253,132,180,249,86,186,2,152,225,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
