It has been by turns praised and condemned by leading literary critics. In the wake of the Fritzl case, for example, she was accused of &quot;executing 'hysterical' portraits of Austrian perversity&quot;. Likewise, her political activism encounters divergent and often heated reactions. Despite the controversy surrounding her work, Jelinek has won many distinguished prizes; among them are the Georg BÃƒÂ¼chner Prize in 1998; the MÃƒÂ¼lheim Dramatists Prize in 2002 and 2004; the Franz Kafka Prize in 2004; and the Nobel Prize in Literature, also in 2004.
