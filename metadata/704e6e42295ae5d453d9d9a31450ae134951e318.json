Recipes reflect the seasons of New England, featuring a wealth of regional products and lauding ChaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite eateries. Native fare includes plenty of dishes featuring maple, blueberries, and pumpkin, as well as farmstand and coastal seafood favorites. The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sections include appetizers, chicken, and baked goods. An entire chapter is dedicated to lobster, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an abundance of classic chowders, soups, and stews. For a little bivalve bliss, there are SalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stuffed quahogs and mussels with fennel and tomatoes. A chapter on meat mains includes broiled lamb shoulder chops with cranberry and a peperonata. Maple and pear muffins with a walnut streusel, and a Vermont breakfast puff of bacon and cheddar, welcome the New England morning. Chock-full of eloquent essays and across-the-fence anecdotes, these uncomplicated recipes are rugged regional classics with original accents designed to deliver home-cooked comfort","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704e6e42295ae5d453d9d9a31450ae134951e318","amp;dn":"New+England+Open-House+Cookbook+-+Sarah+Leah+Chase+%28epub%29+%5BMenta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704e6e42295ae5d453d9d9a31450ae134951e318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,78,110,66,41,90,229,212,83,217,217,163,20,80,174,19,73,81,227,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
