Uncertainty over which compound is responsible for a particular health benefit forces analysts to look for marker compounds, sometimes at extremely low levels, and sometimes as part of a matrix possessing its own individual obstacles. Increasing interest from the media, the scientific and nutritional community, and the end consumer, demand a single, comprehensive resource focused on the analysis of this complex category.\nMethods of Analysis for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals, Second Edition updates all analytical methods from the first edition to reflect dramatic advances in this field. Providing timely and accurate information with contributions from national and international experts, it presents more than 85 % new or revised information. The addition of three entirely new chapters on the burgeoning field of polyphenol analysis reflects the growing interest in antioxidants by the scientific and lay community. \nDivided into 10 chapters, this book gathers updated, in-depth treatments of the methods of analysis for phytoestrogens, fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, flavonoids, anthocyanins, carotenoids and provitamin A, chlorophylls, water soluble vitamins, amino acids, and carbohydrates. It also includes specialty information such as the use of residues from vineyards and oil production for phenolic compounds.\nThoroughly reviewed by a leading panel of scientific peers, the second edition of this highly successful volume is an invaluable source of information for laboratories involved in the food, dietary supplement, and pharmaceutical industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6ebe0e4b3a5945f44fe9f4b087e0cdf87198d9","amp;dn":"Methods+of+Analysis+for+Functional+Foods+and+Nutraceuticals+2nd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6ebe0e4b3a5945f44fe9f4b087e0cdf87198d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,110,190,14,75,58,89,69,244,79,233,244,176,135,224,205,248,113,152,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
