It was written by Frank Miller and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz. Though it features the Marvel Comics character of Elektra, it is outside of mainstream Marvel continuity.\n\nAutore: Frank Miller\nTitolo: Elektra: Assassin\nTipologia: Albo\nLingua: Inglese\nAnno: Marvel Comics 1986-87\nNazionalitÃƒÂ : USA\nGenere: COMIC\nDimensione del file: 76.6 MB (80,330,752 bytes)\nFormato del file : CBR\n\n.: Trama :.\n\nWarning: Significant plot details follow.\nThe story starts out with Elektra in a mental institution in South America, attempting to recover her memory. (It is deliberately left vague whether this takes place prior to her appearances in Daredevil, or whether it details a subsequent resurrection; subsequently, the series has been dismissed from continuity altogether.) The first issue is very disjointed, as she pieces together jumbled memories ranging from the murder of her mother, molestation by her father (which she says is actually an invented memory), to more recent events such as an assassination she carried out. This led her to discover the existence of The Beast, which controls people by forcing them to drink its milk. At first, The Beast's motives are unclear, but it is gradually revealed that it is attempting to bring about a nuclear war. When its initial plans fail, it launches the presidential campaign of Ken Wind (with a face resembling a grainy Dan Quayle photograph, whose resemblance is a coincidence, according to Sienkiewicz [1]). Wind proves extremely popular through various platitudes which disguise his evil nature; when Wind takes over, he will launch a nuclear attack on Russia, bringing about mutually assured destruction.\n\nElektra uses her psychic powers to escape, running afoul of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Garrett. Garrett, an alcoholic, feels ashamed and becomes obsessed with Elektra, but she manages to stay one step ahead of him. She traps him in a building which is blown up, and most of his body is destroyed. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s experimental cybernetics division builds him a robotic body and attaches his head. His psychic bond with Elektra continues to grow, and he eventually realizes he is powerless against her. She sets out to stop the Beast, killing various subordinates and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the process. In response, Nick Fury sends Chastity, a strictly by-the-book agent. Perry, Garret's former partner, has now been turned into a cyborg with the mind of a sociopath implanted in it. Chastity learns of this, and informs Fury, but Perry manages to escape before S.H.I.E.L.D can deactivate him. Perry is extremely dangerous and eventually comes under the service of the beast. The Beast manages to get Wind elected president, but Elektra thwarts the plan with her psychic powers and ninja skills. In a final confrontation, Elektra manages to injure the beast, terminate Perry and transfer the mind of Garrett into Ken Wind and vice versa before her and Garrett are captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. As Chastity is giving her final report to the president about what happened, we realize that in the end, Garrett, in the body of Wind, is the president, and Elektra, using her psychic powers yet again, manages to escape S.H.I.E.L.D after she has recovered by placing her mind in one of the blue helper dwarfs, knocking out Chastity and then releasing her own body.\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4b1009fc2b707f0f76e1d5ca8757e4709cde5c","amp;dn":"Frank+Miller+-+Elektra%3A+Assassin%2C+%5BCBR+-+Eng+-+Tar%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4b1009fc2b707f0f76e1d5ca8757e4709cde5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,75,16,9,252,43,112,127,15,118,225,213,202,135,87,228,112,156,222,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
