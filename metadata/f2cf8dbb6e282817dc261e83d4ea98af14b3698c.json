(In utter defiance of historical accuracy, the team consists of three Americans and one Brit.) Armed with jeeps equipped with .50-caliber machine guns--and endless chutzpah--they wage a highly irregular war against Rommel's Afrika Korps. Their most common nemesis is Hauptmann Dietrich, though Dietrich and the Rats join forces from time to time against a common enemy. \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060018/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060018/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n480x360\nFrame Rate 29/frames per second\nTotal bitrate 2238 kbps\n\nEnjoy the show, and please seed to help preserve this classic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2cf8dbb6e282817dc261e83d4ea98af14b3698c","amp;dn":"The+Rat+Patrol+-+Season+2+%5BDVDRip%5D%5BXviD%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2cf8dbb6e282817dc261e83d4ea98af14b3698c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,207,141,187,110,40,40,23,220,38,30,131,212,234,152,175,20,179,105,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
