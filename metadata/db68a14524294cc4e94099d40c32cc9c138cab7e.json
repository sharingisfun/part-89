Therefore, I downloaded all songs as videos from YouTube in HD and converted them, however YT only supports Audio bitrate up to 256kbps, even if you upload in tru-320kbps, so this is the reason for the Standard bitrate. I also tried to get it in the same naming format as iTunes uses, however I have not included track numbers. Also I would include Artist - Album however I have no idea how to do this from .mp3 files to a text list, so I have just included the song names list below. \n\nAbsentee Songs (as I dont believe they exist yet): \nTigerlily &amp; The Only - Daylight\nNorthbrooke - On a Train (KOMES Remix)\n\nSong Names:\n\nRambo (Hardwell Edit)\nTurn Down For What\nWon't Look Back (Radio Edit)\nWe Were Young\nBlur (COMBO!
