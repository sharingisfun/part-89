A novel thermomass theory is used as the theoretical basis, which provides a general heat conduction equation for the accurate prediction of non-Fourier heat conduction. In order to prove the validity of this thermomass theory, a large current was used to heat the metallic nanofilm at the minimum temperature of 3 K. The measured average temperature of the nanofilm was notably higher than the prediction of FourierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heat diffusion equation, while matching well with the general heat conduction equation. This is the first time that steady non-Fourier heat conduction has been observed. Moreover, this book concerns the role of electron-phonon interaction in metallic nanofilms, which involves the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at low temperatures and interfacial thermal resistance at femtosecond timescales. Readers will find useful information on non-Fourier heat conduction and the latest advances in the study of charge and heat transport in metallic nanofilms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:735ad611638ec5cf8591e43de32d98b0133d2a05","amp;dn":"Theoretical+and+Experimental+Studies+on+Non-Fourier+Heat+Conduct","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"735ad611638ec5cf8591e43de32d98b0133d2a05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,90,214,17,99,142,197,207,133,145,228,61,227,45,152,176,19,61,42,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
