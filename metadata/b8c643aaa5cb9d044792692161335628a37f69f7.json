Starting up with Champion's SND-\nlike remix of Flava D's 'Home', Terror\nDanjah and Zed Bias tie-off the deft 2-\nstep of 'Telepathy' and Killjoy goes on a\ndark one with the militant bounce of\n'Turnt Ones VIP' and the hydro-blazing\n'Most High'. You'll catch Flava D 'In The\nDance' on a dread bassline flex, and,\nlikewise Hybrid Theory and Trilla with the\ndark and rude 'Dutty' killer, plus a\nslower tribal remix of Hayfever from\nMickey Pearce, and a pair of proper UK\nriddims from Terror Danjah featuring grime\nstars Meridian Dan, Hyper, President T, 9\nMilli Major, and Badness.
