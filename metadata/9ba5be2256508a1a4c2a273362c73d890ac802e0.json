The band has released three albums: Big Moon Ritual, The Magic Door, and Phosphorescent Harvest. The band consists of Robinson, guitarist Neal Casal, keyboardist Adam MacDougall, bassist Mark Dutton, and drummer Tony Leone (who replaced original drummer George Sluppick in January 2015).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFormation And Big Moon Ritual:\n------------------------------\n\nChris Robinson Brotherhood began as an experiment but became a 'band' during their California residency tour. The original intention, according to Robinson, was to &quot;have a local L.A. band, just play in California, see where the music takes us and have a good time.&quot; They then embarked on an 118 date North American tour in 2011. Robinson names Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh and Bob Weir, who sat in with the band during CRB's run at the Great American Music Hall, as both musical inspirations and friends. As well as Robinson, the band features fellow Black Crowes member Adam MacDougall, Ryan Adams collaborator Neal Casal, bassist Mark Dutton, and drummer George Sluppick. Robinson describes the Brotherhood as a &quot;farm-to-table psychedelic band&quot;.\n\nChris Robinson Brotherhood released a version of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; (written by Carl Perkins) b/w a live version &quot;Girl, I Love You&quot; (written by Al Bell and Eddie Floyd) for Record Store Day on April 21, 2012. The CD version also features a cover of the Jimmy Reed song, &quot;Bright Lights Big City&quot;.\n\nThe band's debut album, Big Moon Ritual, was recorded at Sunset Sound Studios, Los Angeles, and was released on June 5, 2012. Chris Robinson suggests that Big Moon Ritual is &quot;not a concept album, but it's very conceptual sonically.&quot; He also notes that CRB &quot;isn't the type of band that's going to make a concise four-minute song record&quot; and that they prefer instead to make lengthier compositions.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Magic Door:\n---------------\n\nJust three months after its predecessor, on September 11, 2012, Chris Robinson Brotherhood's second studio album, The Magic Door, was released. It was recorded at the same time as Big Moon Ritual and features a cover of the Hank Ballard song &quot;Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go,&quot; which the band has often played live.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Betty's S.F. Blends, Volume One&quot;\n---------------------------------\n\nIn September 2013, CRB (Chris Robinson Brotherhood) released an album that featured songs picked by the Grateful Dead's record producer, Betty Cantor-Jackson, which were recorded over five nights in San Francisco. The band played 96 songs altogether and Cantor-Jackson picked the best ones for the album. The album has only been released on vinyl record format, which results in it not being available on CD. The album was called &quot;Betty's S.F. Blends, Volume One&quot;. The 5 full shows are also available as separate downloads.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent Members:\n----------------\n\nChris Robinson: lead vocals, guitars (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nNeal Casal: guitars, vocals (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nAdam MacDougall: keyboards, vocals (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nMark Dutton: bass, vocals (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nTony Leone: drums (2015Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\n\nPast Members:\n-------------\n\nGeorge Sluppick Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2015)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProduct Description From Amazon:\n--------------------------------\n\n\n2012 release from the Black Crowes frontman, the companion album to Big Moon Ritual, released in June of this year. Each album spotlights seven tunes, with The Magic Door containing six originals plus a cover of Hank Ballard's 'Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go', a CRB set list staple. Chris Robinson (lead vocals, guitar), Neal Casal (guitar, vocals), Adam MacDougall (keys, vocals), George Sluppick (drums) and Mark Dutton (bass, vocals) create exciting musical sparks throughout The Magic Door. 'We really feel these records set the stage for another full year, where we'll see how far we can go with it,' says Robinson. 'We already feel successful because we have the freedom to do what we want. And it's always cosmic. The times demand it.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ba5be2256508a1a4c2a273362c73d890ac802e0","amp;dn":"Chris+Robinson+Brotherhood+-+The+Magic+Door+%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ba5be2256508a1a4c2a273362c73d890ac802e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,165,190,34,86,80,138,26,76,42,39,51,98,199,61,137,10,200,2,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
