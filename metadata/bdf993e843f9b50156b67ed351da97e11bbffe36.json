The Editors have assembled a team of 25 authors from the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, representing a full range of international expertise from academic, industrial, and government research backgrounds.\nAfter introductory chapters which present the chemical, physical, functional and microbiological characteristics of dairy ingredients, the book addresses the technology associated with the manufacture of the major dairy ingredients, focusing on those parameters that affect their performance and functionality in food systems. The popular applications of dairy ingredients in the manufacture of food products such as dairy foods, bakery products, processed cheeses, processed meats, chocolate as well as confectionery products, functional foods, and infant and adult nutritional products, are covered in some detail in subsequent chapters. Topics are presented in a logical and accessible style in order to enhance the usefulness of the book as a reference volume.\n\nIt is hoped that Dairy Ingredients for Food Processing will be a valuable resource for members of academia engaged in teaching and research in food science; regulatory personnel; food equipment manufacturers; and technical specialists engaged in the manufacture and use of dairy ingredients.\n\nSpecial features:\n\nContemporary description of dairy ingredients commonly used in food processing operations\nFocus on applications of dairy ingredients in various food products\nAimed at food professionals in R&amp;D, QA/QC, manufacturing and management\nWorld-wide expertise from over 20 noted experts in academe and industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf993e843f9b50156b67ed351da97e11bbffe36","amp;dn":"Dairy+Ingredients+for+Food+Processing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf993e843f9b50156b67ed351da97e11bbffe36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,249,147,232,67,249,181,1,86,182,126,211,81,218,151,225,27,191,254,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
