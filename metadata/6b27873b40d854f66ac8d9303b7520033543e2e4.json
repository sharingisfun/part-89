The concepts I'm studying at Univesity do not fit neatly into one category; therefore, directories are inadequate.\n\nSetup:\nExtract the contents of WML.zip into a folder.  If you have trouble getting the program to run, extract to the root of an external hard drive or ram drive. This software was made to run on Windows XP.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b27873b40d854f66ac8d9303b7520033543e2e4","amp;dn":"Wippich+Media+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b27873b40d854f66ac8d9303b7520033543e2e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,39,135,59,64,216,84,246,106,200,217,48,59,117,32,3,53,67,226,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
