It was released in June 1979, through \n\nrecord labels Rather and Rough Trade.\n\nConsidering their strange story, it's hardly a wonder that the two albums Swell Maps cut are as weird and wonderful as \n\nthey are. The two records-- 1979's A Trip to Marineville (the title was taken from an episode of &quot;Stingray&quot;) and 1980's \n\nJane From Occupied Europe-- are nothing if not consistent. In the case of Swell Maps, that means consistently manic, \n\nunfocused, chaotic, uniquely unprofessional, and quite charming. There aren't any other records from the post-punk era \n\nthat sound quite like these-- Television Personalities' And Don't the Kids Just Love it comes close for cheekiness, but \n\ndoesn't match them sonically-- and the reckless abandon and spontaneity of the band and producer John Rivers shines \n\nbrightly and brilliantly on these remasters. Not that hi-fi sound was ever central to the Swell Maps experience, but it \n\ncertainly doesn't hurt.\nSeparating the albums contextually, one could say that Marineville is more song-oriented and Jane is more jam-centered. \n\nThat's correct, to a point. The fact is that both albums veer erratically from bursts of eccentric punk and (probably \n\ninebriated) harmony vocals into nightmarish noise concoctions, offering catchy psych-punk nuggets almost as an excuse for \n\nthe improvised scrapings that surround them. Principle vocalist Nikki Sudden sounds like he thinks the band could have a \n\nhit on the relatively accessible and melodic &quot;Another Song&quot; and &quot;Spitfire Parade&quot;, but the band also veer far into \n\nleftfield on squalls of loosely sculptured sound such as &quot;Adventuring into Basketry&quot; and &quot;Big Maz in the Desert&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de2d261f54feac9e2fddbed101b5ea1121095f25","amp;dn":"Swell+Maps+-+1979+-+A+Trip+To+Marineville+%28extra+tracks%29+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de2d261f54feac9e2fddbed101b5ea1121095f25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,45,38,31,84,254,172,158,47,221,190,209,1,181,234,17,33,9,95,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
