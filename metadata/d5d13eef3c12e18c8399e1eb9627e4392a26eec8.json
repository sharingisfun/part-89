In fact his contribution to Madchester earned him the title, 'The Godfather Of House'. In forming M People ('Mike's People'), he also provided success for three other talented musicians in Londoner's Paul Heard, Andrew Lovell (better known as 'Shovell'), and the brilliant vocalist Heather Small.\nThe distinctive voice of Heather, ex-wife of England Rugby League star Shaun Edwards, immediately won M People critical acclaim. It was therefore no surprise that their debut single &quot;Colour My Life&quot;, was a hit in 1991 (and also on its re-release in 1992)\nM People's first album, &quot;Northern Soul&quot;, was named after the legendary Mancunian style of music that found fame in the Wigan Casino which was often visited by Mike. &quot;I'm an old Northern Soul boy and I always thought that the Northern House scene was the modern equivalent of the old Northern Soul scene&quot;, he was later quoted as saying. The album was re-released in 1992 with an amended track listing to include their second single, &quot;How Can I Love You More&quot;, which was a huge hit and introduced M People to a mass audience. (prideofmanchester.com)\n\n\nThis album still remains the defining sound of the 90s dance scene, it does not seem to have dated at all, possible because it has never been improved on and Heather Small's voice defines a whole generations first trip into that dark chasm of Lerv!!\nAt this late date this CD plays like a greatest hits collection since the tracks are so well known and have been danced to from underlit clubs to over decorated wedding receptions. I defy anybody to not get up and shake the hips whenever or wherever this is played. I love every honeyed moment of it!!\nIf you dont have this in your music collection in one form or another then there is a serious lack there.
