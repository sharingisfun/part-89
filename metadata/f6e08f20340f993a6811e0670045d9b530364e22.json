The double-disc, 40-song collection features some of the popular tunes from Elvis Presley's remarkable run of 31 Hollywood movies, including show-stopping numbers like &quot;What I'd Say&quot; from Viva Las Vegas and &quot;Rock-A-Hula Baby&quot; from perennial fan-favorite Blue Hawaii. Also included are the #1 hits &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; plus 17 more Top 40 singles and classic contributions from legendary songwriters Jerry Leiber &amp; Mike Stoller, Doc Pomus &amp; Mort Shuman, and Otis Blackwell.\n\nThough much has been made of the notion that Elvis's success as a matinee idol put the last nail in the coffin of his rock-&amp;-roll rebel status, ELVIS AT THE MOVIES threatens to put the lie to that theory. Listening to this collection of tunes that sprang from the King's films, it's striking to realize how many of his most popular tracks had a big-screen background. The quintessential Elvis ballad &quot;Love Me Tender,&quot; the Big House barnstormer &quot;Jailhouse Rock,&quot; the kitsch classic &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;--they all made their home in the cinema.\n\nOf course, this 40-track compendium is dominated by more obscure tunes. The casual Elvis admirer isn't likely to be familiar with the bongo-driven beach-pop of &quot;Do the Clam&quot; or &quot;Charro,&quot; which combines spaghetti-western sounds with psychedelic-cowboy lyrics about &quot;standing alone at the crossroads of your mind.&quot; At the same time, esoteric soul-tinged cuts like &quot;Clean Up Your Own Backyard&quot; illuminate an underexposed corner of the Elvis catalog, making ELVIS AT THE MOVIES all the more valuable.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc One:\n01.
