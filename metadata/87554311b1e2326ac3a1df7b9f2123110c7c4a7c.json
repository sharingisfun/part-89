Legendary figures in American submarine history come to life in actual logs of undersea warfare, and in accounts of sailors who were in the van of torpedo tactics development. The technology is explained in detail, showing how American subs have been so successful in their hundred-year history. Outlandish gags and pranks of submarine skippers are included, showing just how brazen this elite group of super-competent sailors could be. The reader travels through World War II and the Cold War as submarines and torpedoes enter the nuclear age. The book is filled with diagrams and illustrations.\n\nBook Cover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://img.bi/#/5QPZ18I!tr6aXwKIEPYA0mNpPAZ7dCTgD587zQThFUHQTnWQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://img.bi/#/5QPZ18I!tr6aXwKIEPYA0mNpPAZ7dCTgD587zQThFUHQTnWQ&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87554311b1e2326ac3a1df7b9f2123110c7c4a7c","amp;dn":"Submarine+Torpedo+Tactics%3A+An+American+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87554311b1e2326ac3a1df7b9f2123110c7c4a7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,85,67,17,177,226,50,106,195,161,223,123,159,33,35,17,12,124,74,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
