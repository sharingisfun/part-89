A member of the cabin crew clings to his legs as the co-pilot completes an emergency landing. The captain is found to be still alive after being outside the cockpit for 21 minutes. The window blow-out was caused by a maintenance worker installing incorrectly sized bolts during maintenance work.\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: : AVC\nVideo Bitrate: : 2,165 kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: : 1.78, (16x9)\nVideo Resolution: : 1280x720\nScan type : Progressive\nAudio Codec: : AAC LC\nAudio language: : English\nAudio Bitrate: : 160 kbps\nAudio Channels: : 2 (stereo)\nRun-Time: : 52mn\nFramerate: : 29.970 fps\nNumber of Parts: : 25\nContainer : MP4\nPart Size: : 870 MiB\nSource: : DVD\nEncoded date : 2014-07-19\nEncoded by: : Egilman ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:943afe54585a4bd3acfa99f21e97859763576f9f","amp;dn":"Mayday.Air.Crash.Investigations.S02.E01.Blow.Out.DVD.720p.x264.A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"943afe54585a4bd3acfa99f21e97859763576f9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,58,254,84,88,90,75,211,172,250,153,242,30,151,133,151,99,87,111,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
