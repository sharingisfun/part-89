The Very Best Of Free &amp; Bad Company featuring Paul Rodgers collects 15 of the very best of his catalog as a songwriter and recording artist including his chart-topping works in Free and Bad Company. &quot;This collection captures the essence of my music career over the last forty years,&quot; said Rodgers. &quot;I hope that it serves as thanks to all our fans for their incredible support.&quot;  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBad Company are a British rock supergroup formed in Westminster, London in 1973 by two former Free band members Ã¢â‚¬â€œ singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and King Crimson bassist Boz Burrell. Peter Grant, who managed the rock band Led Zeppelin, also managed Bad Company until 1982.\n\nBad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Their first three albums, Bad Company (1974), Straight Shooter (1975) and Run With the Pack (1976), reached the top five in the album charts in both the UK and US. Many of their singles, such as &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot;, and &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;, remain staples of classic rock radio.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Free was an English rock band formed in London in 1968, best known for their 1970 signature song &quot;All Right Now&quot;. They disbanded in 1973 and lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become a frontman of the band Bad Company along with Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler and died from a drug-induced heart failure at the age of 25 in 1976. Bassist Andy Fraser formed Sharks.\n\nThe band was famed for its sensational live shows and nonstop touring. However, early studio albums did not sell very well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until the release of Fire and Water which featured the massive hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;. The song helped secure them a place at the huge Isle of Wight Festival 1970 where they played to 600,000 people.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Free was one of the biggest-selling British blues rock groups; by the time the band dissolved in 1973, they had sold more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. &quot;All Right Now,&quot; remains a rock staple, and had been entered into ASCAP's &quot;One Million&quot; airplay singles club.\n\nRolling Stone has referred to the band as &quot;British hard rock pioneers&quot;. The magazine ranked Rodgers No. 55 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;,[8] while Kossoff was ranked No. 51 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.\n\nFree was signed to Island Records in the UK and A&amp;M Records in North America. Both labels became part of the PolyGram group in 1989, then Universal Music Group in 1998; UMG now controls the band's catalogue worldwide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead8ca3e59755765e94c70610c1f7148e76d696f","amp;dn":"Free+%26amp%3B+Bad+Company+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%5B2010%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead8ca3e59755765e94c70610c1f7148e76d696f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,216,202,62,89,117,87,101,233,76,112,97,12,31,113,72,231,109,105,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
