In terms of his strategic and political achievements Leyasu ranks as JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest samurai commander. Leyasu possessed the rare wisdom of knowing who should be an ally and who was an enemy, a key skill for a successful military leader. LeyasuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crowning victory at Sekigahara depended on the defection to his side of Kobayakawa Hideaki, and the absence from the scene of IeyasuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son Hidetada serves to illustrate how just once there was a failure in IeyasuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s otherwise classic strategic vision. To establish his family as the ruling clan in Japan for the next two and a half centuries was abundant proof of his true greatness. \n\nToyotomi Hideyoshi: The background, strategies, tactics and battlefield experiences of the greatest commanders of history\n\nArguably the greatest military commander in the history of the samurai, Toyotomi Hideyoshi rose from the ranks of the peasantry to rule over all Japan. A student of the great unifier Oda Nobunaga, Hideyoshi would later avenge the murder of his master at the battle of Yamazaki. \n\n After consolidating his position, Hideyoshi went on the offensive, conquering the southern island of Kyushu in 1587 and defeating the Hojo in 1590. By 1591, he had accomplished the reunification of Japan. This book looks at the complete story of Hideyoshi's military accomplishments, from his days as a tactical leader to his domination of the Japanese nation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea5e2ff414f756158cb1f57d07da675db53c9090","amp;dn":"Tokugawa+and+Hideyoshi+-leadership+strategy+conflict+%282013%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea5e2ff414f756158cb1f57d07da675db53c9090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,94,47,244,20,247,86,21,140,177,245,125,7,218,103,93,181,60,144,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
