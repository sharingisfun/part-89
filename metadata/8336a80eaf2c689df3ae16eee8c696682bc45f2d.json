No more tape noise, no more problems with worn out tape\nreels. However, digital sound is perceived to be somewhat &quot;sterile&quot; and \ncold&quot;, compared with high quality analog recordings. Magneto brings the \npositive qualities of analog recording to your digital system, by \nrecreating the sound of analog tape saturation. It's suitable for nearly\nany musical instrument: drums, bass, vocals, synth, ... And of course for\nthe final mix!\n\nAnd Magneto doesn't stop at just simulating the sound of the tape: the \nbehaviour of a complete analog tape machine was analyzed and implemented\nwithout the drawbacks of that media, of course). Once you have added \nMagneto to your system, you'll never want to live without it again!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8336a80eaf2c689df3ae16eee8c696682bc45f2d","amp;dn":"Steinberg+Magneto+1.5+Plugin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8336a80eaf2c689df3ae16eee8c696682bc45f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,54,168,14,175,44,104,157,243,174,22,238,232,198,150,104,43,196,95,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
