Health law policy researcher Timothy Caulfield finds out in this thoroughly unique, engaging, and provocative book about celebrity culture and its iron grip on todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s society.\n\n Over the past decade, our perceptions of beauty, health, success, and happiness have become increasingly framed by a popular culture steeped in celebrity influence and ever more disconnected from reality. This isn't just a hyperbolic assertion. Research tells us that our health decisions and goals are influenced by both celebrity culture and celebrity endorsements, our children's ambitions are now overwhelmingly governed by the fantasy of fame, and the ideals of beauty and success are mediated through a celebrity-dominated worldview.\n\n But while much has been written about the cause of our obsession with the rich and famous, Caulfield argues that not enough has been done to debunk celebrity messages and promises about health, diet, beauty, or the secret to happiness. From the obvious dangers, to body image of super-thin models and actors, or Gwyneth PaltrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enthusiastic endorsement of a gluten free-diet for almost everyone, or Jenny McCarthyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ill-informed claims of the risks associated with vaccines, celebrity opinions have the power to dominate our conversations and outlooks on our lives and ourselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecc7dbc43858e39668678749d56032a784c32a37","amp;dn":"Is+Gwyneth+Paltrow+Wrong+About+Everything%3F%3A+How+the+Famous","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecc7dbc43858e39668678749d56032a784c32a37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,199,219,196,56,88,227,150,104,103,135,73,213,96,50,167,132,195,42,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
