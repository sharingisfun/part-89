Produced by Frazier \n\nMohawk, it was released on Elektra Records. Described by critic Simon Reynolds as &quot;one of the most harrowing and death-\n\nfixated albums in rock history&quot;,[1] The Marble Index was written by Nico and features musical arrangements by John Cale, \n\nwho had worked briefly with Nico during her collaboration with the Velvet Underground.\n\nThough a commercial failure upon release, the record has since received acclaim from music critics and has influenced \n\ndecades of music to come.\n\nThe Marble Index was produced in a period of Nico's life that biographers tend to barely probe.[2] Jim Morrison, who Nico \n\nlater referred to as &quot;[her] soul brother&quot;, encouraged her to write her own songs; Simon Reynolds described this as &quot;a key \n\nbreakthrough for [her].&quot;[3] A hippie in San Francisco sold Nico a harmonium,[4] an instrument with which &quot;she discovered \n\nnot only her own artistic voice, but a whole new realm of sound.&quot;[5] The droning pump organ became her trademark.[6]\n\nRegarding the album's recording process, John Cale remarked, &quot;I was pretty much left alone for two days, and I let [Nico] \n\nin at the end. I played her [the album] song by song, and she'd burst into tears. 'Oh! It's so beautiful!', 'Oh, it's so \n\nbeautiful!' You know, this is the same stuff that people tell me, 'Oh! It's so suicidal!'&quot;[4]\n\nThe music of the album was a new style for Nico, distancing herself from rock and pop.[5][8] Anne Marie Micklo, in her \n\n1969 Rolling Stone review, described it as &quot;mood music, with an obscure and elusive text recited over it.&quot;[9] The album \n\nalso unveiled Nico's songwriting, as Chelsea Girl featured none of her compositions. Her lyrics deal with introspective \n\nand somber themes. The tracks were originally recordings of Nico singing over her droning harmonium; Cale later added \n\nmusical arrangements on top, reminiscent of European classical, avant-garde and folk music.[8][10] The resulting \n\nsoundscape has been described as &quot;stark&quot;, &quot;dislocating&quot;, &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;frightening&quot;. Anthony Carew of About.com described \n\nit thus: &quot;Bleeding out sombre laments and brutal dirges of intense medievalism, she sounds for all the world like she's \n\nwandering through the valley of death&quot;.[5] Richie Unterberger of AllMusic described it as &quot;an uncompromisingly bleak, \n\ngothic soundscape&quot;.[8]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88507e8be3ebb8b16a3def92001266f9101711d7","amp;dn":"Nico+-+1968+-+The+Marble+Index+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88507e8be3ebb8b16a3def92001266f9101711d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,80,126,139,227,235,184,177,106,61,239,146,0,18,102,249,16,23,17,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
