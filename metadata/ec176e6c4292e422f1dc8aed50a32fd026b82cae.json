I composed it with the original broadcast from 1997 and a partial re-broadcast from last year. That allowed me to get rid of many parts (not all) where the DJs were talking. There are 2 audience recordings of this show, but none of them sound good enough. Anyway, I took the solo of Gene from one of that audience recordings to fix some missing part before and during the intro of &quot;God Of Thunder&quot;. The songs that remain missing with good quality are Deuce&quot;, &quot;King Of The Night Time World&quot; and &quot;Black Diamond&quot; (including &quot;La Bamba&quot; during the intro). But I added the 4 radio promos at the end of the show.\n\nTo come up with this audio I used 3 sources: my own old 90 min tape, the audio Eltiburon taped in 1997 and also the new broadcast taped by Leomet2000. \n\nI want to thank Eltiburon and Leomet2000 for their kind help!\n\nCD 1:\n01-Let me go rock and roll\n02-Do you love me\n03-Firehouse\n04-Watching you\n05-Shock me\n06-Ace's solo\n07-Calling dr. love\n08-Shout it out loud\n09-I was made for lovin' you\n10-Cold gin\n11-C'mon and love me\n\nCD 2:\n01-Love gun\n02-Gene's solo (aud)\n03-God of thunder\n04-Peter's solo\n05-2000 man\n06-100000 years\n07-Detroit rock city\n08-Beth\n09-Rock and roll all nite\n10-Radio promo 1\n11-Radio promo 2\n12-Radio promo 3\n13-Radio promo 4\n\nIn the meantime, Let's keep this as an exclusive of this site. \nPlease don't upload it at other sites and don't convert it to any lossy format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec176e6c4292e422f1dc8aed50a32fd026b82cae","amp;dn":"kiss+-+Buenos+Aires%2CArgentina+1997-03-14+SOUNDBOARD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec176e6c4292e422f1dc8aed50a32fd026b82cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,23,110,108,66,146,228,34,241,220,138,237,80,163,47,208,38,184,44,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
