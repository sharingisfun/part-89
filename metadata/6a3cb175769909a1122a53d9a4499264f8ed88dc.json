The player can carry three weapons at a time and an assortment of grenades, as well as drive some of the vehicles appearing on the map. Health is regenerated by performing executions on incapacitated people. If the player is killed, the level restarts entirely unless the player completed additional sidequests that provide a limited number of respawn points.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe plot of Hatred revolves around a man (The Crusader) who is sick and tired of humanity's existence. The Crusader grabs his AK-47 to start his &quot;Genocide Crusade&quot; on the streets of New York City. The Crusader begins killing all civilians and police, who are trying to stop him. The Crusader travels to the Police Station at &quot;One Police Plaza&quot; District to kill all remaining police officers (dubbed &quot;Human Shields&quot; due to the police trying to protect civilians). After killing all the &quot;Human Shields&quot;, The Crusader plans to ambush all the reinforcements coming to him in the sewers. A full team of S.W.A.T. officers arrive, with The Crusader ruthlessly killing them all. After exiting the sewers, The Crusader comes across an armed hipster who fires at him at the announcement ride. The Crusader returns fire, and leaves by hijacking a train.\n\nDuring the Train ride, The Crusader discovers there is a nuclear power plant in New Jersey, he begins to slaughter everyone on board, including an armed Mafia, and the train operator (who did not notice that he was behind him). The S.W.A.T teams arrives and exchanges fire with The Crusader. The Crusader then leaves by hijacking one of the APC tanks.\n\nThe Crusader then begins to slaughter people in the train station and Chinatown. He begins to slaughter all Triads Mafia, including civilians in the process. Meanwhile spreading the bloodshed, The Crusader discovers the Military are now hunting him down. The Crusader heads straight Downtown to investigate the gathering crowd.\n\nArriving Downtown with a Flamethrower, The Crusader discovers that a politician named JosÃƒÂ© Morales has gathered all remaining human population. He also discovers that JosÃƒÂ© was the one who brought the military to go after him. After slaughtering everyone, The Crusader leaves for the Military station on foot to procure explosives for use in the Nuclear Plant.\n\nThe Crusader arrives at the military base at Fort Oconor by the West Gate. The Crusader slaughters every soldier in the base and the military is completely overwhelmed. The Crusader remarks that he has succeeded in being a &quot;One Man Army&quot; by eliminating all military opposition. The Crusader exits Fort Oconor with C4 charges, and heads to the Nuclear Plant in New Jersey.\n\nIn the ending, The Crusader storms the nuclear power plant with the intention of overloading the reactor, and destroying the rest of the city. After entering the code (666), he is attacked by a group of soldiers, and gleefully accepts his fate while laughing maniacally. With his dying breath, he activates the trigger, wondering if the explosives will work. After the explosion destroys the city, the posthumous voice of The Crusader scoffs &quot;Well, they did.&quot;\n\n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a3cb175769909a1122a53d9a4499264f8ed88dc","amp;dn":"HATRED+32play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a3cb175769909a1122a53d9a4499264f8ed88dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,60,177,117,118,153,9,161,18,42,83,217,164,73,146,100,248,237,136,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
