It is not a technical manual, nor is it procedure-led. Instead, it encourages creative learning of project engineering methodology that can be applied and modified in different situations.\nIn short, it offers a distillation of practical Ã¢â‚¬Ëœon-the jobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experience to help project engineers perform more effectively. While this book specifically addresses process plants, the principles are applicable to other types of engineering project where multidisciplinary engineering skills are required, such as power plant and general factory construction.\n\nIt focuses on the technical aspects, which typically influence the configuration of the plant as a whole, on the interface between the various disciplines involved, and the way in which work is done Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the issues central to the co-ordination of the overall engineering effort.\n\nIt develops an awareness of relationships with other parties Ã¢â‚¬â€œ clients, suppliers, package contractors, and construction managers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and of how the structure and management of these relationships impact directly on the performance of the project engineer. Readers will welcome the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straightforward approach in tackling sensitive issues head on","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d961cc9609c40ebb73fde7206539cb2687fe53e4","amp;dn":"Handbook+for+Process+Plant+Project+Engineers+-+Peter+Watermeyer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d961cc9609c40ebb73fde7206539cb2687fe53e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,97,204,150,9,196,14,187,115,253,231,32,101,57,203,38,135,254,83,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
