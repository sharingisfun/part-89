The band existed from 1976 to 1996, with a brief return in 2006, although they had a period of inactivity between 1989 and 1994. Their music has been categorized as space rock, and lyrics are dominated by science fiction themes. In November 2011, Cameron Hawkins reformed the band with two new players.\n\nIn 2006, FM reformed again for a live performance at NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA on June 24, and also gave a concert prior to this in Toronto on June 16. The new lineup included Italian musician Claudio Vena on electric violin and electric mandolin. No recordings by this lineup have been issued, and the band's website has not been updated since 2006.\n\nIn 2010, Martin Deller uploaded a video on YouTube, advertising for drumming and recording lessons. The video consists of clips from the NEARfest 2006 performance which is also mentioned as being an upcoming release.\n\nSince 2011, Cameron Hawkins has worked on material with a new incarnation of FM. Joining Hawkins are Paul DeLong on drums, Aaron Solomon on violin, and Ed Bernard of Druckfarben on viola and mandolin. The band is putting the finishing touches on songs for a new album that is to be released by Esoteric Recordings.\n\nOn May 12, 2014, Nash the Slash died at age 66.\n\n2015 saw FM's first studio album in 28 years. Transformation was released in April via Esoteric/Cherry Red Recordings.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--------\nMembers:\n--------\n\nCameron Hawkins\nPaul DeLong\nAaron Solomon\nEd Bernard\n\n\n-------------\nPast Members:\n------------- \n\nNash the Slash\nMartin Deller\nBen Mink\nSimon Brierly\nGreg Critchley\nRandy Cooke\nMartin Shaw\nPaul Marangoni\nClaudio Vena\nIvana Popovic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fdd4e3875f7189f1b4a32eaeef7c31766006645","amp;dn":"FM+-+NEARfest+2006+%5B2006%5D%5B2014%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BLIVE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fdd4e3875f7189f1b4a32eaeef7c31766006645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,221,78,56,117,247,24,159,27,74,50,234,238,247,195,23,102,0,102,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
