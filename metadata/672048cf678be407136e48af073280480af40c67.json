Sussex is one of the powerhouse regions of the country and deserves a business magazine with a fiercely independent editorial outlook, no poorly disguised advertorials, an informative and entertaining read and an editorial stance that speaks directly to business leaders across the entire South East region, regardless of the size of the company.\n\nOur aim is to ensure the magazine is stylish, contemporary and national in appearance but with regional content. With this in mind, we assembled a PBM Steering Committee, comprising ten CEOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from leading companies across the region, with whom we meet regularly to ensure that we remain relevant and current.\n\nPlatinum Business Magazine is THE voice of business in the South East","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:672048cf678be407136e48af073280480af40c67","amp;dn":"Platinum+Business+Magazine+-+Issue+11%2C+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"672048cf678be407136e48af073280480af40c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,32,72,207,103,139,228,7,19,110,72,175,7,50,128,72,10,244,12,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
