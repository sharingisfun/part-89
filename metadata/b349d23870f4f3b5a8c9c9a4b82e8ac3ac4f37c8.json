New sensor technologies, more advanced real-time models, and faster computers are enabling better control systems for these processes. Specific topics include but are not limited to: (1) novel sensors for hostile-environment materials processes, such as online inclusion detection, temperature, and velocity in molten materials, surface condition of hot moving products, etc.; (2) innovative online sampling and analysis techniques, (3) models for real-time process control and quality monitoring systems; (4) process automation, scheduling, and plant-wide logistics optimization, (5) control of composition, temperature, microstructure, and morphology in sintering, smelting, refining, solidification, reheating, deformation, and transport of ores, slags, mattes, metals, materials, and aqueous solutions; (6) prediction, monitoring, control, and optimization of process parameters in these systems; (7) control in manufacturing processes, including casting, annealing, forging, rolling, extrusion, powder metallurgy, electronic materials, welding, etc.; (8) control of impurities and environmentally undesirable components in product and waste streams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b349d23870f4f3b5a8c9c9a4b82e8ac3ac4f37c8","amp;dn":"Sensors%2C+Sampling%2C+and+Simulation+for+Process+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b349d23870f4f3b5a8c9c9a4b82e8ac3ac4f37c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,73,210,56,112,244,243,181,168,201,201,164,184,46,138,195,172,79,55,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
