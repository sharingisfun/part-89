Improved forecasting techniques, altered naming systems, and new intensity and duration records are only a few of the changes that have taken the meteorological world by storm in recent years. As a result of improvements in forecasting and warning systems, landfall and intensity predictions are much more accurate and timely, thereby reducing economic costs and enhancing life safety.&quot;Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones, New Edition&quot; features significant updates and information on recent weather phenomena and the devastation and loss that often resulted. Hurricanes Andrew, Gilbert, and Wilma are covered in detail in this comprehensive reference, as well as the most destructive and deadly tropical cyclone witnessed in the United States in the last 50 years - Hurricane Katrina. As the historic and vibrant city of New Orleans continues to rebuild and reconstruct in the aftermath of this hurricane, national meteorological agencies and research institutions suffer from the deadly effects of under-funding and political neglect. Between 2005 and 2006, hurricane-related damage in the United States totaled $168 billion, and nearly 1,500 lives were lost - grim tallies that lend credence and urgency to the call for a centrally organized, multi-agency response to tropical cyclone activity in this country, and indeed, around the globe.Focusing on these issues and more, this completely revised edition features more than 85 all-new, black-and-white photographs and line illustrations, a revised introduction, historical and cultural entries, extensively revised front and back matter, a bibliography of print and Web resources, a chronology, and an index","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d16e0b3585e870572f8251caf724fd20e6ee1c20","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Hurricanes%2C+Typhoons+and+Cyclones+Pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d16e0b3585e870572f8251caf724fd20e6ee1c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,110,11,53,133,232,112,87,47,130,81,202,247,36,253,32,230,238,28,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
