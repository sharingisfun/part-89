The club anthems, &quot;Good Life,&quot; &quot;Ain't Nobody Better,&quot; &quot;Do You Love What You Feel,&quot; and &quot;Big Fun&quot; are slices of old-school house music that's as good as it gets. The first edition of this album also had a stellar, seductive ballad, &quot;Power of Passion,&quot; which was replaced by a formidable cover of Stephanie Mills's signature hit &quot;What You Gonna Do With My Lovin'.&quot; \nGrey's voice is smooth and rich without being showoffy or overemotional, and it's the right match for Saunderson's tight house grooves which sometimes have a slight dash of techno. Most dance albums have one or two songs weighed down by tons of filler, but not this one. \n&quot;Paradise&quot; is a consistent, thoroughly satisfying album that has as much as a groove as it did in 1989. (Customer from Amazon)\n\n\n\nn the 1980s and '90s, a lot of dance music spotlighted female singers with thin, weak voices who seem on the verge of death. But house music has often been a home to expressive, big-voiced divas who can truly wail -- a fine example being Paris Gray of the duo Inner City. \nAlong with producer/composer Kevin Saunderson, Gray was responsible for some of the most rewarding dance music of the late '80s and early '90s. Inner City's debut album, Big Fun (titled Paradise in the U.K.), is full of house gems that enjoyed extensive dance club exposure, including &quot;Good Life,&quot; &quot;Do You Love What You Feel,&quot; &quot;Ain't Nobody Better,&quot; and the title song. \nWhile Saunderson's production is decidedly high-tech, Gray's warm, passionate singing is mindful of dance music's heritage and underscores its soul and gospel roots in a delightful way. \nUnfortunately, Inner City never crossed over to the R&amp;B or pop markets as Virgin Records hoped -- an irony considering that Big Fun is so much more individualistic and soulful than most of the generic efforts that dominated black radio in 1989.
