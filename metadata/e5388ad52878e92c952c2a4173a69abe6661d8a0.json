In The Age of Edison, award-winning author and historian Ernest Freeberg weaves a narrative that reaches from Coney Island and Broadway to the tiniest towns of rural America, tracing the progress of electric light through the reactions of everyone who saw it and capturing the wonder EdisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invention inspired. It is a quintessentially American story of ingenuity, ambition, and possibility in which the greater forces of progress and change are made by one of our most humble and ubiquitous objects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5388ad52878e92c952c2a4173a69abe6661d8a0","amp;dn":"The+Age+of+Edison+-+Ernest+Freeberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5388ad52878e92c952c2a4173a69abe6661d8a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,56,138,213,40,120,233,44,149,44,42,65,115,166,154,190,102,97,216,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
