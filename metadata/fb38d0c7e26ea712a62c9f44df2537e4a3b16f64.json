Also known as Su Wen, or The Yellow EmperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inner Classic, this influential work came into being over a long period reaching from the 2nd century bce to the 8th century ce. Combining the views of different schools, it relies exclusively on natural law as conceptualized in yin/yang and Five Agents doctrines to define health and disease, and repeatedly emphasizes personal responsibility for the length and quality of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. This two-volume edition includes excerpts from all the major commentaries on the Su Wen, and extensive annotation drawn from hundreds of monographs and articles by Chinese and Japanese authors produced over the past 1600 years and into the twentieth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb38d0c7e26ea712a62c9f44df2537e4a3b16f64","amp;dn":"Huang+Di+Neijing+-+Su+Wen+by+Paul+Unschuld+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb38d0c7e26ea712a62c9f44df2537e4a3b16f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,56,208,199,226,110,167,18,166,44,159,68,223,37,55,228,163,177,111,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
