They need special controls like crossfaders, loops, effects, etc, in order to &quot;mix&quot; the songs.\n\n----------------------\nWhy VirtualDJ\n----------------------\t\n\nVirtualDJ is the most used DJ software on the planet, with more than 150 million downloads, and is used by everybody from bedroom DJs to international superstars.\n\nUnlike some competitors, it doesn't rely on your years of experience learning how to DJ, but instead uses modern technology to help you mix better by focusing on the artistic side of the mix.\n\n----------------------\nRequirements\n----------------------\n\n- Minimum: Windows XP\n- Recommended: Windows 7 or Window 8.1\n\n----------------------\nNew in Version 8\n----------------------\n\nThis version is a significant milestone in the history of VirtualDJ. Unlike the transition to v7 from v6, or to v6 from v5 etc, where we just added new significant features (like video support, 99 decks, ContentUnlimited, etc), for the v8 transition, we rewrote our software from the ground up. VirtualDJ was first started in 1996, and in the following 15 years, we kept adding more and more features, to keep pushing the limit of how technology can help you mix better. But, 15 years of layers upon layers of new code, can get quite messy, and our development speed was slowing down. That's why we spent the last 3 years to rewriting everything clean and fresh, so that for the next 20 years, new breakthrough features will keep coming at lightning speed, update after update. \n\nHomepage: http://www.virtualdj.com/\n\n----------------------------------\nFile: Atomix Virtual DJ Pro 8.0.2348.rar\nSize: 39 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55476ac9efe9d76705fa66b693c1a05cfb5c2ca","amp;dn":"Atomix+VirtualDJ+Pro+8.0.2348+Multilingual+-+R2R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55476ac9efe9d76705fa66b693c1a05cfb5c2ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,84,118,172,158,254,157,118,112,95,166,107,105,60,26,5,207,181,194,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
