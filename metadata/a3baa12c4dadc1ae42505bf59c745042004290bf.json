Both albums reached the Top 10 US Country chart, spawning the hits 'No More Hanging On', 'Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough', 'I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone' and 'Who's Gonna Play This Old Piano'. With his new biography getting rave reviews, Jerry Lee's profile is as huge as ever. Digitally remastered and slipcased, and with new notes by Andrew McRae.\n\nAnother collection of work from Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe killerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Jerry Lee Lewis; this time we have two albums from his Mercury catalogue from the early 1970s (1972, and 1973 respectively) during his comeback country years. Jerry LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s selection of material is on paper good, not least due to him calling on the work of Harlan Howard, Dallas Frazier &amp; Owens, Foster &amp; Rice, Billy Joe Shaver, Paul Craft and the likes of Ray Griff (Ã¢â‚¬Å“WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gonna Play This Old PianoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Morning After Baby Let Me DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nComplimented by Andrew McRaeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s copious liner notes, where he underlines my sentiments more than once on how Jerry LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are doused in over use of strings, as a result his cutting edge, and unique phrasing doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the impact hoped. But it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all doom and gloom, there are occasions he cuts through this. As on gospel piece Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wall Around HeavenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (written by Carmon Holland, Jerry and long time friend, Carl Harrelson), easy paced shuffle Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bottom DollarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the flowing Ã¢â‚¬Å“No Traffic Out Of AbileneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jimmy Webb) as he speaks of standing at the side of the road with his thumb stuck out, and few takers on the highway to help him out. Others of note include Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes A Memory AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t EnoughÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, ShaversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ brilliant Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ride Me Down EasyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (as covered by Johnny Rodriguez, Bobby Bare and others), and to a degree Ã¢â‚¬Å“What My Woman CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t DoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, if only Lewis was allowed to show off some real arrogant swagger and it would be a great recording! As for the remainder, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Left, YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re RightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Mark Vickery) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Think I Need To PrayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as he speaks of becoming lost, and looking for redemption for the wrongs heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done the benchmark is lifted. While GriffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Morning After Baby Let Me DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has all the right ingredients for the Killer to mop up, his performance though good it lacks pep! It is like he might have been singing, and playing but his mind was elsewhere as he made these albums. From accounts known, and problems he was having, as was pretty much was the case with ol' Jerry Lee for a two or more decades as one marriage, divorce and tragedy took place in his life.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWho's Gonna Play This Old Piano...
