Anthony gets into some of his late night tweets, old school satire TV, we learn Forrest Tucker, George Raft, and Milton Berle had enormous cocks, and Eli Roth calls in to yap about his show Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shark After Dark,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learned from it, movies that contribute to fear of sharks, shark myths, the effect the movie Alien had on him, his directing gigs on Hostel and Hostel: Part II, and technology that protects sharks. We go through the newest on the NY prison break dude, discuss the difficulty of breaking out of jail, artwork done by criminals and the people who collect them, get a teaser of an upcoming TACS Ã¢â‚¬Å“CribsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ episode, and look at a frightening shark video. Rich Vos calls to talk about his upcoming gigs, bitch about car maintenance, explain why heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not in studio, trash Fred and his tacos, clarify the apology he gave for the Ã¢â‚¬Å“joke gone awryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on Opie and JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show, and proves heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the ultimate Jew with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“TaylorMade GolfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ story. The guys also talk about backlash on jokes, Gregshells, Amy Schumer, the impact Opie and Anthony had on Vos, what BonnieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to, engage in a little chat about Israel, the influence of the media, manipulative Jews, the pushback on PC, hypocritical bloggers, gay marriage, consistency (or lack thereof) in racism, and hypocrisy across the US. The day ends with a horrifically skinny Tim Burton chick, looking at the trailer from Ã¢â‚¬Å“Creed,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we see a sweet pic of John McCain getting nailed, talk about ZuckerbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“AI system,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ virtual reality headsets, subliminal messaging, MacyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vs. Trump, GavinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s #TakeUsDown campaign, and a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Why I Hate Long IslandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ article.\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77884de2f3bc4b71e45856efc7f560e2c0348df4","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-07-01+Rich+Vos+Eth+Matt+Iseman+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77884de2f3bc4b71e45856efc7f560e2c0348df4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,136,77,226,243,188,75,113,228,88,86,239,199,245,96,226,192,52,141,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
