The group released two studio albums and one live EP before Frehley left the band to release his 1989 solo album, Trouble Walkin'.\n\nContents\n\n    1 Background\n    2 Personnel\n        2.1 Members\n        2.2 Lineups\n    \n   \nBackground\n\nBefore forming a band for his post-KISS career, Frehley had previously done a solo album in 1978. Frehley's Comet featured numerous guest vocalists, with Will Lee as the bassist. Future Frehley's Comet member Anton Fig was also involved.\n\nIn 1989, for Trouble Walkin' , Frehley changed the lineup again and released the album under his own name rather than the bandÃ‚Â´s. Tod Howarth was replaced by a returning Richie Scarlet, and Jamie Oldaker by ex-Riot drummer Sandy Slavin. Session work was also done by old Frehley's Comet drummer Anton Fig. The album featured numerous guest vocalists. The band continued until 1995, with Richie Scarlet remaining throughout, and John Regan departing in 1992. Ace Frehley put his solo career on hold to rejoin KISS in 1996. He has since resumed his solo career.\nPersonnel\nMembers\n\n    Ace Frehley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, lead vocals (1984-1988)\n    John Regan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, drums, backing vocals (1984-1988)\n    Anton Fig Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (1984-1987)\n    Richie Scarlet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, vocals (1984-1985)\n    Arthur Stead Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards (1984-1985)\n    Tod Howarth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, piano (1986-1988)\n    Billy Ward Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion (1987-1988)\n    Jamie Oldaker Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion, backing vocals (1988)\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLead vocals \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Rock Soldiers&quot;   \tAce Frehley, Chip Taylor \tFrehley \t5:05\n2. \t&quot;Breakout&quot;   \tFrehley, Eric Carr, Richie Scarlet \tTod Howarth \t3:38\n3. \t&quot;Into the Night&quot;   \tRuss Ballard \tFrehley \t4:12\n4. \t&quot;Something Moved&quot;   \tHowarth \tHowarth \t4:02\n5. \t&quot;We Got Your Rock&quot;   \tFrehley, Marty Kupersmith \tFrehley \t4:12\n6. \t&quot;Love Me Right&quot;   \tFrehley, Ira Schickman \tFrehley \t3:54\n7. \t&quot;Calling To You&quot;   \tFrehley, Howarth, Kevin Russell, Jim McClarty \tHowarth \t4:20\n8. \t&quot;Dolls&quot;   \tFrehley \tFrehley \t3:28\n9. \t&quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;   \tFrehley \tFrehley \t4:02\n10. \t&quot;Fractured Too&quot;   \tFrehley, John Regan \t(Instrumental) \t4:14\nWell The way its going in time ill have most of Frehley's work on my pages.....seed.....seed.......seed.......seed......seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0d7d3f3bbe600caace7a0500c3df74add76cfa9","amp;dn":"Frehley%27s+Comet++mp3++320k+++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0d7d3f3bbe600caace7a0500c3df74add76cfa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,215,211,243,187,230,0,202,172,231,160,80,12,61,247,74,221,118,207,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
