Anyways here's a review from IMDB\n\nThis episode, if not stronger, is as strong as the pilot. It picks up right where the action left in episode 1. A new character is introduced, a strong one, I say. Matt Murdock's abilities are being explored here. Backstories are still in right places. I love how it presents both sides of the Man without fear. While it shows him a merciless killer, it never makes us overlook his humanity. The final sequence is mind blowing. Another realistic and believable episode. I can say, this early, this show is on the right track. It can still use some improvements in character developments and pacing, I guess. Charlie Cox has been so amazing doing the job, I'm very impressed how well he carrie his character and how believable his portrayal has been so far. Really nice job","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c5e0500c4bc286a252c43d1121417b3d8ac5023","amp;dn":"Daredevil+2015+season+1%2C+episode+1+-Cut+Man+-+720p+-+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c5e0500c4bc286a252c43d1121417b3d8ac5023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,94,5,0,196,188,40,106,37,44,67,209,18,20,23,179,216,172,80,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
