In the summer of '93 I used to hear &quot;Sweet Harmony&quot; every morning on my drive into work, and I was hooked. I later bought their first album (Happiness) and their latest (X) when it was released. This is the album to start with if you're interested in The Beloved. \nThe songs on this album are mellow, beautiful, and very danceable. Grooves that reach out and pull you in combined with flawless musical arrangements make this album a must have. As a whole, the album only has one subpar track out of eleven. &quot;Paradise Found&quot; is a bit boring at over 7 minutes. But the rest of this album is amazing. My favorite tracks (believe me, it's difficult to pick) are &quot;Spirit,&quot; the aforementioned &quot;Sweet Harmony,&quot; &quot;Outerspace Girl,&quot; and &quot;Dream On.&quot; But, like I said, the rest of this album is amazing as well. \nJon Marsh's lead vocals make the music seem even more soothing. &quot;Let The Music Take You&quot; is the title of one of the tracks and it's good advice for those who buy this album. The mood of it is very relaxing and free. It's a beautiful album that gives you a great feeling when you listen to it, so let it pull you in and put you in a good mood. \nConsisting of Jon Marsh, his wife Helena, and on this album a host of other musicians, the Beloved are the best group nobody has ever heard of. This is a meticulously crafted album. I currently own over 350 discs and this one makes my top five. Need I say more?
