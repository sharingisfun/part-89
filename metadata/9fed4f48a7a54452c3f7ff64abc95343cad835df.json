Charles (Evan Peters) is a high school senior with physical challenges, Vickie (Juno Temple) is a troubled runaway turning tricks at a truck stop, and Skid (Kevin Alejandro) is her dangerously psychotic pimp, who has a huge chip on his shoulder. He continuously harasses Charles and Vickie, but things take a menacing turn when the two embark on a road trip up the California coast to photograph lighthouses. Skid canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand the imagined betrayal and comes looking to punish Vickie, armed with a hunting knife.
