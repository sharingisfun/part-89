They tell us resistance is futile and that we must join the NEW world order under control of THEIR global government and that's exactly what we're letting them do, DEFEAT us without one shot fired and without even defending ourselves.\n\nWho is behind it? The prince of this world; Satan.\nThat's not to say that our current governments are GOOD. But it is saying that the coming world government will be consolidated down into one centralized control mechanism that will make it much easier to literally control the entire world, which is what the antichrist will do. And to be perfectly candid with you, we are already under complete control of world government and that the only thing left of our national governments is an empty husk, a remenant simply leftover for appearance's sake that allows the populace to believe everything is still ok.\n\nCan we really Stop Globalization&quot;?  The answer is No! The Bible says we can not stop what is coming, but it also says we Christians are the salt of the earth and that we should stand against the wiles of the devil. Not just go along with it willingly.  This is a battle and we must Warn Everyone. Show others these facts and lead them to the Bible, the King James Version.\n\nStop Globalization. Stand against the wiles of the devil. Put on the whole armor of God. Let's not just sit back and say we are defeated before we begin. Don't make it EASY for Satan! Submit to God and don't worry about what the devil is doing.\n\nJames 4 verse 7 says,\n&quot;Submit yourselves therefore to God.\nResist the devil, and he will flee from you.&quot;\n\nThat's God's PROMISE to you. Ignore Satan and pay close attention to God and HIS instructions and submit to God, not the devil, and the devil *WILL* flee from you. Not just a maybe.\nGod bless you all :)\n~Jeff The watchman\n\n&quot;the interview&quot; includes the following ...\nJoe Biden,the interview,obama,bush,bill clinton,hillary,cronkite,world federalist,global governence,award,traitor,treason,world government, one world, one world order,antichrist,follow Jesus, follow your heart debunked!, the world says follow your heart, God says follow Him!\nWarn everyone.
