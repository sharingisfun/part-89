She's sure of it. She likes guacamole and cigarettes and steak. She knows how to use a phone. She even remembers what clothes are for. \n\nAfter all, she was a normal American herself, once. \n\nThat was a long time ago, of courseÃ¢â‚¬â€before the time she calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“adoption day,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ when she and a dozen other children found themselves being raised by a man they learned to call Father.\n\nFather could do strange things. He could call light from darkness. Sometimes he raised the dead. And when he was disobeyed, the consequences were terrible. \n\nIn the years since Father took her in, Carolyn hasn't gotten out much. Instead, she and her adopted siblings have been raised according to Father's ancient Pelapi customs. They've studied the books in his library and learned some of the secrets behind his equally ancient power. \n\nSometimes, they've wondered if their cruel tutor might secretly be God. \n\nNow, Father is missing. And if God truly is dead, the only thing that matters is who will inherit his libraryÃ¢â‚¬â€and with it, power over all of creation. \n\nAs Carolyn gathers the tools she needs for the battle to come, fierce competitors for this prize align against her. \n\nBut Carolyn can win. She's sure of it. What she doesn't realize is that her victory may come at an unacceptable priceÃ¢â‚¬â€because in becoming a God, she's forgotten a great deal about being human","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cadb9e812b2527d44212a4359301de0c0784950","amp;dn":"The+Library+at+Mount+Char+-+Scott+Hawkins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cadb9e812b2527d44212a4359301de0c0784950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,173,185,232,18,178,82,125,68,33,42,67,89,48,29,224,192,120,73,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
