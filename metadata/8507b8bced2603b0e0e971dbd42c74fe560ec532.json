Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\n\nEpisode 179 &quot;White is the New Black&quot; - Ant jumps right into the Rachel Dolezal story to discuss her resignation and the hypocrisy surrounding identification, he plays a clip proving Rachel isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the first person to Ã¢â‚¬Å“act black,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we see a pic of someone who also might be black, and he touches on Eternal Con with Sam Roberts and Mick Foley. The guys chat about a Ã¢â‚¬Å“CribsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ episode of TACS, Bobo on a bus, they come up with a great Kickstarter idea for RosieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paw, and apparently the compassion levels are low when it comes to injured dogs. Ant goes back to Rachel Dolezal weighing out pros and cons, we watch a clip covering Ã¢â‚¬Å“identifies as,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ant rants on Ã¢â‚¬Å“identifies as,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the callers weigh in on Rachel Dolezal and have excellent banter with Anthony. (Good job guys!) We see pics of the new studio, talk about a Dallas PD shooting and the way CNN covered it, Bill Maher, proper identification for Ã¢â‚¬Å“trans,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dr. Steve calls and attempts to explain the criteria for legally switching genders, the guys talk Ã¢â‚¬Å“hate facts,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dig into MondayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mail, and Dr. Steve calls back with a proper answer and explanation. We read a news story about a home invasion covered differently in the media, Ant waxes on the importance of protecting yourself, moves to the poker table to talk with Jeff Abrams about his product Promescent and its importance, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, the arousal gap, reverse cowgirl, and making love with recklessness abandonment. Jeff talks about his partner in business being murdered and their backstory, what heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like the legacy of Promescent to be, and we hear about the issue he recently had with Jenny McCarthy.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8507b8bced2603b0e0e971dbd42c74fe560ec532","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-06-15+White+is+the+New+Black+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8507b8bced2603b0e0e971dbd42c74fe560ec532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,7,184,188,237,38,3,176,224,233,113,219,212,44,116,254,86,14,197,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
