At 13, he started writing songs, later teaching himself to play guitar. While attending college at Appalachian State, he formed a band, the Mountain Boys, that played around western North Carolina. After graduating with a degree in marketing, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in country music. It took him a year to get a song publishing deal with Sony/ATV Tree, after which he started getting his songs recorded by other artists, an example being Terri Clark's version of &quot;The World Needs a Drink.&quot; He met producer Jay Joyce, who took an interest in him as a recording artist, and they began making demos. That led to his being signed by Capitol Records Nashville. \n\n\nGenre................: Country\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: EMI Nashville\nIncluded.............: Front Cover &amp; auCDtect\n\n\n01.The Outsiders\n02.A Man Who Was Gonna Die Young\n03.Cold One\n04.Roller Coaster Ride\n05.Talladega\n06.Broke Record\n07.Like A Wrecking Ball\n08.That's Damn Rock &amp; Roll\n09.Dark Side\n10.Devil, Devil (Prelude Princess Of Darkness)\n11.Give Me Back My Hometown\n12.The Joint\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7699f51e88455c00887fa3e2f517419482c1a29f","amp;dn":"Eric+Church+-+The+Outsiders+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7699f51e88455c00887fa3e2f517419482c1a29f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,153,245,30,136,69,92,0,136,127,163,226,245,23,65,148,130,193,162,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
