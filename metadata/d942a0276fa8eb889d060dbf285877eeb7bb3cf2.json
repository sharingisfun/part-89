Called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The TonesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, they consist of a beautiful hand-crafted wooden pyramid shaped structure that stands over eight feet tall which houses a series of different sized tubular metal chimes. When struck with a mallet they produce exquisite sounds which reverberate and sustain creating a sea of harmonic overtones.&quot;\nMichael Diamond Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Music Editor, Awareness Magazine\n\n&quot;I believe this is the first review IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever written about a musical instrument that is brand new! The Butterfly Tones CD consists of nine original tracks ranging in duration from 2Ã¢â‚¬â„¢21Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to 10Ã¢â‚¬â„¢55Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - four are more than ten minutes long. The sound of The Tones resembles wind chimes, but Tuller creates melodies rather than merely the random sounds of wind chimes. The resonating hum of The Tones also resembles the sound of singing bowls, but since Tuller is striking the tubes with a mallet, he has more control of the pitches of the hum. Because of the percussive nature of a performance on The Tones, it is also possible for interesting rhythms to be created, making this a more versatile instrument than one might expect. Some of the tracks have a more ambient than melodic feeling, and each piece stands on itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own as unique. I would think this music would be an ideal accompaniment for massage, meditation, and relaxation by allowing The Tones to take a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s focus and consciousness into a new musical realm altogether. It could also help with sleep difficulties, as the sounds are slow, soothing, and rather hypnotic.\nButterfly Tones is a very different musical experience and one well worth checking out! Recommended especially for the musically adventurous.\n\nKathy Parsons, Music Reviewer for Mainly Piano\n\n&quot;There are many brilliant musicians in this world, but how many of them created the instrument as well as the music that it plays. The Tones are a one of a kind instrument that Coburn has spent 15 years designing and perfecting. To watch him play is a delightful and inspiring experience. Coburn created the Tones and the Tones celebrate. I invite you to listen with your Spirit.&quot; Namaste Mary Millen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d942a0276fa8eb889d060dbf285877eeb7bb3cf2","amp;dn":"Coburn+Tuller+-+Butterfly+Tones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d942a0276fa8eb889d060dbf285877eeb7bb3cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,66,160,39,111,168,235,136,157,6,13,191,40,88,119,238,183,187,60,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
