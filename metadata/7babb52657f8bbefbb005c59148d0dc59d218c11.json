It was a commercial success and marked a return to the public eye for Bush after the relatively poor sales of her previous album The Dreaming. It was Bush's second album to top the UK Albums Chart and her best-selling studio album, having been certified double platinum for 600,000 sales in the UK, and by 1998 it had sold 1.1 million copies worldwide. In the US, it reached the top 40 on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe album's lead single, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;, became one of Bush's biggest hits, and it produced three further successful singles, &quot;Cloudbusting&quot;, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;, and &quot;The Big Sky&quot;, all taken from the album's first side. The second side forms a concept album about a person drifting alone in the sea at night.\n\nHounds of Love received critical acclaim on its release and in retrospective reviews. It is considered by many fans and music critics to be Bush's best album, and has been regularly voted one of the greatest albums of all time. The album was nominated at the 1986 BRIT Awards for Best Album, where Bush was also nominated for the awards for Best Producer, Best Female Artist, and for Best Single (&quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;).\n\n\nTrack Listing\n01 - Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\n02 - Hounds of Love\n03 - The Big Sky\n04 - Mother Stands for Comfort\n05 - Cloudbusting\n06 - And Dream of Sheep\n07 - Under Ice\n08 - Waking the Witch\n09 - Watching You Without Me\n10 - Jig of Life\n11 - Hello Earth\n12 - The Morning Fog\n\nSummary courtesy of Wikipedia.
