But after a crash he finds himself in a mysterious underworld, the hollow earth. Here he has to stop a villain who wants to destroy the world...\n\nThe player indirectly controls his character with a traditional point &amp; click interface. He explores his environment, collects everything he finds and solves inventory based puzzles. He also meets various enemies which he fights by throwing rocks at them. These rocks are infinite. Sometimes the player can also use items to avoid enemies, e.g. a tin of tomato soup as distraction.\n\nAnother game element is the pilot's dog: the player can call him and give him simple orders, e.g. to fetch something. The mouse cursor doesn't change its form over interactive elements and there is no manual saving: the game automatically saves.\nInstall\n--------\nUnrar and run Agharta.exe\n\n\nTested on Windows 7 x64 and Windows XP x86. Scanned with AVG.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1bbac8e1fb3ec1a63e519c176ed5f41e7b801c1","amp;dn":"Agharta+-The+Hollow+Earth+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1bbac8e1fb3ec1a63e519c176ed5f41e7b801c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,187,172,142,31,179,236,26,99,229,25,193,118,237,95,65,231,184,1,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
