Briscoe was a top-rated Middleweight contender during the 1970s, unsuccessfully challenging for the World Title on three different occasions. His record reads like a &quot;who's who&quot; list of prominent fighters from his era.\n\nBennie was known for his toughness, strong punch and body punching. He fought future middleweight champion Monzon to a draw in Buenos Aires on May 6, 1967, but dropped a 15 round decision to the champion in a 1972 title match. Briscoe was outpointed by former welterweight and middleweight king Emile Griffith in their first match, but fought Griffith to a draw in a rematch. He was outpointed by future middleweight champions Marvin Hagler and Vito Antuofermo.\n\nBriscoe was one of the most feared middleweights of his era. In 2003, he was named to the The Ring's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.[2] His final record was 66-24-5 with 53 knockouts and one No Contest.\n\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler (born Marvin Nathaniel Hagler; May 23, 1954)[1] is a retired American professional boxer who was Undisputed World Middleweight Champion from 1980 to 1987. Hagler made twelve undisputed title defenses and holds the highest KO% of all middleweight champions at 78%. At six years and seven months, his reign as undisputed middleweight champion is the second longest of the last century, behind only Tony Zale. In 1982, annoyed that network announcers often did not refer to him by his nickname, &quot;Marvelous&quot;, Hagler legally changed his name to Marvelous Marvin Hagler.&quot;[2]\n\nHagler is an inductee of the International Boxing Hall of Fame and the World Boxing Hall of Fame. He was named Fighter of the Decade (1980s) by Boxing Illustrated and twice named Fighter of the Year by Ring Magazine and the Boxing Writers Association of America. In 2001 and 2004 the Ring named him the 4th greatest middleweight of all time[3] and in 2002 named him the 17th-greatest fighter of the past 80 years. The International Boxing Research Organisation (IBRO) rates Hagler as the sixth-greatest middleweight of all time.[4] Boxrec rates Hagler the fifth-best middleweight of all time.[5] Many analysts and boxing writers consider Hagler to have one of the best &quot;chins&quot; in boxing history.[6]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c2e1441f6354911cddaba8b8afd294cc513b823","amp;dn":"Hagbrisco.mpeg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c2e1441f6354911cddaba8b8afd294cc513b823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,46,20,65,246,53,73,17,205,218,186,139,138,253,41,76,197,19,184,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
