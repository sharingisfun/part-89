The editors comprise an archaeologist, a historian and an architectural historian and the contributors include archivists, ecclesiastical and legal historians as well as the authors of six recent research theses. In their different ways they show the distinctively regional and national qualities of Scottish urban life in the medieval period as well as the effects of Scotland's main cultural and trading links with the Baltic, Netherlands and France. The book is divided into four thematic sections dealing with source materials; ecclesiastical organisation; trade and industry; and social structure and administration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e7584899c941117848956b9c613efbf1a6de6d","amp;dn":"The+Scottish+medieval+town.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e7584899c941117848956b9c613efbf1a6de6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,231,88,72,153,201,65,17,120,72,149,107,156,97,62,251,241,166,222,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
