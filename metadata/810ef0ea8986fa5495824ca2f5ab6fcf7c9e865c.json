She wrestled with fresh design ideas and inexpensive interior finishes, but a year on her home remains incomplete and is now under threat. With driving wind and rain causing damage to the unfinished exterior, Piers must find a way to reinvigorate Sumati to complete her home before it's too late.\n\nYoung Devon farmers, Justin and Mary, spent every penny they had creating their first home together. Today it is home to baby Oscar too, but their low cost home is dominated by a forest of baby gates and their prime living spaces have become cramped and cluttered. With a budget of just Ã‚Â£200, Piers is challenged to come up with a bespoke design solution to reclaim their precious space - but having shied away from distinctive design ideas in the past, will Justin and Mary take the leap?\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/3iGn4TjxVq.png[/img]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/44/769/c9owSI0nVA.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:810ef0ea8986fa5495824ca2f5ab6fcf7c9e865c","amp;dn":"The+House+That+100k+Built+2015+06+22+The+Final+Fix+Episode+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"810ef0ea8986fa5495824ca2f5ab6fcf7c9e865c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,14,240,234,137,134,250,84,149,130,76,162,245,171,111,207,124,158,134,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
