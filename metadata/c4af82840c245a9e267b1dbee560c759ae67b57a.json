Both the editors and authors are internationally recognized experts from different fields in industry and academia, and their contributions describe all aspects of intelligent integrations of chemical reactions and physical unit operations such as heat exchange, separational operations and mechanical unit operations. As a unique feature, the book also introduces new concepts for treating different integration concepts on a generalized basis. Of great value to a broad audience of researchers and engineers from industry and academia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4af82840c245a9e267b1dbee560c759ae67b57a","amp;dn":"Integrated+Chemical+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4af82840c245a9e267b1dbee560c759ae67b57a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,175,130,132,12,36,90,158,38,123,29,190,229,96,199,89,174,103,181,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
