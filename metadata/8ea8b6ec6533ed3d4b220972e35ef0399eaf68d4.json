Optimal Control of Induction Heating Processes demonstrates how to apply and use new optimization techniques for different types of induction heating installations.\nFocusing on practical methods for solving real engineering optimization problems, the text features a variety of specific optimization examples for induction heater modes and designs, particularly those used in industrial applications. The book describes basic physical phenomena in induction heating and induction heating process (IHP) optimization problems as well as IHP mathematical models for practical use. It explains the fundamentals of the new exact method and the advantages it offers over other well-known methods.\n\nA sound introduction to the broad theory of optimal control, Optimal Control of Induction Heating Processes presents a clear and accessible approach to the modern design and control of practical, cost-effective induction heating processes. This book is ideal for all students, production managers, engineers, designers, scientists, and users of induction heating machinery who would like to study, design, and improve processes of induction mass heating","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ea8b6ec6533ed3d4b220972e35ef0399eaf68d4","amp;dn":"Optimal+Control+of+Induction+Heating+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ea8b6ec6533ed3d4b220972e35ef0399eaf68d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,168,182,236,101,51,237,61,75,34,9,114,227,94,240,57,158,175,104,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
