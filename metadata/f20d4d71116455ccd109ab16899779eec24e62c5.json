The first concentrates on Honshu; the mountainous main island that is home to most of the country's population. We see that away from the crowded population centres there is a wide variety of wildlife including bears and macaques which can be problematical for the rural populous but also more welcome species including fish that are used for cleaning the dishes in one town! The second episode moves to the subtropical islands of Okinawa where locals farm seaweed and catch deadly sea snakes, and the largest land crabs and smallest wild boar are to be found. Finally in part three we are taken north to Hokkaido where mild summers give way to Siberian winters. Here we see how man lives alongside bears and magnificent Steller's Sea Eagles and red crowned cranes that have been brought back from near extinction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f20d4d71116455ccd109ab16899779eec24e62c5","amp;dn":"BBC+-Japan+Earth%27s+Enchanted+Islands+720p+x265-hAri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f20d4d71116455ccd109ab16899779eec24e62c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,13,77,113,17,100,85,204,209,9,171,22,137,151,121,238,194,78,98,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
