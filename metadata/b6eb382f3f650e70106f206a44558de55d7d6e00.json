The local newspaperman, Colbey, is convinced that Jagger is innocent. He accuses Deputy Pierce of having perjured himself to get a conviction and accuses Sheriff Charlie Koch of just plain laziness in investigating the case.

They soon begin to understand the cause of the darkness that surrounds them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6eb382f3f650e70106f206a44558de55d7d6e00","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+I+Am+The+Night+Color+Me+Black","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6eb382f3f650e70106f206a44558de55d7d6e00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,235,56,47,63,101,14,112,16,111,32,106,68,85,141,229,93,125,110,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
