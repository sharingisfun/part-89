It's goal is the successful design and operation of chemical reactors. This text emphasizes qualitative arguments, simple design methods, graphical procedures, and frequent comparison of capabilities of the major reactor types. Simple ideas are treated first, and are then extended to the more complex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c60fafb66fe7df76e79563693bcf8937d00086c0","amp;dn":"Chemical+Reaction+Engineering+3rd+ed+-+Octave+Levenspiel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c60fafb66fe7df76e79563693bcf8937d00086c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,15,175,182,111,231,223,118,231,149,99,105,59,207,137,55,208,0,134,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
