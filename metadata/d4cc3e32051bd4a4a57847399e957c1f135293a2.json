TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided that the words of Jesus arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always true. The FoundationsÃ¢â‚¬â€Ken HamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature series based on 30 years of ministryÃ¢â‚¬â€reveals the alarming state of Christianity today.\n\nIt was twelve years ago that Ken Ham was last filmed for a major video series. A lot has changed since then. Twelve years ago, terrorists had not yet flown planeloads of people into New York skyscrapers. The American economy was roaring. Tsunamis had not yet left millions of people asking Ã¢â‚¬Å“why?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ America was not simultaneously fighting three different wars. And the president of the United States had not declared that America is no longer a Christian nation.\n\nToday, possibly more than at any time in AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history, a culture detached from God and willingly ignorant of His hand in creation and world events needs Jesus. But the church is not nearly as effective in reaching the lost as it was only a generation ago. There is a foundational reason.\n\nIn this hard-hitting yet often humorous new series, popular Australian-born author Ken Ham uses modern events as the backdrop for the most important messages of his life. By combining his signature talks with cutting edge new graphics and current events headlines, Ham connects with viewers as never before!\n\nThis video is available for purchase (download or DVD) on our website:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelieving:\nCan we profess to believe in the Word of God and not do the Word of God?

What is faith... What is obedience... And to make matters more complicated, how do they all relate to each other... Are they against each other like some teach, or do they work together in His perfect design... Instead of examining each component individually, this study investigates the relationships in detail as scripture teaches it. This study covers material that offers critical scriptural understanding that needs to be a part of every believer's walk. DVD also available at TestEverything.net\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is the Gospel?\nPart 1 - 119 Ministries; What is the Gospel? There are many responses you will get if you randomly ask this question. The popular Christian definition of the gospel is the death, burial and resurrection of Christ. Then, there is the gospel of the kingdom which John the Baptist and Christ himself preached. Also the book of Revelation refers to the end-time preaching of the eternal gospel. What are these gospels, and what are the similarities and differences between them? And Paul speaks of the mystery of the gospel...which the majority today still do not understand...These and other questions will be answered in this study","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4cc3e32051bd4a4a57847399e957c1f135293a2","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+End+Times+-+86+-+Walking+By+Faith+pt3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4cc3e32051bd4a4a57847399e957c1f135293a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,204,62,50,5,27,212,164,165,120,71,57,158,149,124,31,19,82,147,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
