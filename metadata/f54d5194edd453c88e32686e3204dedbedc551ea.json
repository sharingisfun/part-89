Inspired by the killing of British student Meredith Kercher in Italy, THE FACE OF AN ANGEL looks beyond the salacious headlines to explore both the media and the public's obsession with violent stories, whether fictional or real. Thomas Lang (Daniel BrÃƒÂ¼hl) is a film director who is offered the chance to adapt a book by American journalist Simone Ford (Kate Beckinsale), which recounts the controversial trial of American student Jessica Fuller for the murder of her flatmate Elizabeth Pryce. To help with his research, Simone takes Thomas to Siena, where he is disturbed by the media frenzy that has developed around the case.\n\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom\n\nWriters: Paul Viragh\n\nActors: Daniel BrÃƒÂ¼hl, Kate Beckinsale, Cara Delevingne, Valerio Mastandrea\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 41 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f54d5194edd453c88e32686e3204dedbedc551ea","amp;dn":"Face+of+an+Angel.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f54d5194edd453c88e32686e3204dedbedc551ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,77,81,148,237,212,83,200,142,50,104,110,50,4,222,219,237,197,81,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
