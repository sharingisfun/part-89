But two menÃ¢â‚¬â€John Chatterton and John MatteraÃ¢â‚¬â€are willing to risk everything to find the Golden Fleece, the ship of the infamous pirate Joseph Bannister.\n\nAt large during the Golden Age of Piracy in the seventeenth century, BannisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exploits would have been more notorious than BlackbeardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, more daring than KiddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, but his story, and his ship, have been lost to time. If Chatterton and Mattera succeed, they will make historyÃ¢â‚¬â€it will be just the second time ever that a pirate ship has been discovered and positively identified. Soon, however, they realize that cutting-edge technology and a willingness to lose everything arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough to track down BannisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ship. \n\nThey must travel the globe in search of historic documents and accounts of the great pirateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exploits, face down dangerous rivals, battle the tides of nations and governments and experts. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only when they learn to think and act like piratesÃ¢â‚¬â€like BannisterÃ¢â‚¬â€that they become able to go where no pirate hunters have gone before.\n  \nFast-paced and filled with suspense, fascinating characters, history, and adventure, Pirate Hunters is an unputdownable story that goes deep to discover truths and souls long believed lost","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa7d05b10f9c154cfb5f7e8c893e2fad86465d97","amp;dn":"Pirate+Hunters+-+Robert+Kurson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa7d05b10f9c154cfb5f7e8c893e2fad86465d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,125,5,177,15,156,21,76,251,95,126,140,137,62,47,173,134,70,93,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
