The results astonished the world, as participants went from middle-class undergrads to drunk-with-power sadists and submissive victims in just a few days. Winner of two awards at the Sundance Film Festival, including Best Screenplay, and created with the close participation of Dr. Zimbardo himself, &quot;The Stanford Prison Experiment&quot; features an extraordinary cast of rising young actors, including Ezra Miller, Olivia Thirlby, Tye Sheridan, Keir Gilchrist, Michael Angarano, and Thomas Mann.\n\nDirector: Kyle Patrick Alvarez\n\nWriters: Tim Talbott\n\nActors: Billy Crudup, Ezra Miller, Michael Angarano, Tye Sheridan, Johnny Simmons, Olivia Thirlby, Keir Gilchrist, Thomas Mann\n\nGenre: Thriller, Drama\n\nRun Time: 2 hours 2 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd3555fca17724843f9c55a97c596b510728b1e1","amp;dn":"The+Stanford+Prison+Experiment.+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd3555fca17724843f9c55a97c596b510728b1e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,53,85,252,161,119,36,132,63,156,85,169,124,89,107,81,7,40,177,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
