She says kids benefit from less supervision and more independence. Critics say &quot;free range&quot; parenting is irresponsible and dangerous. They could get abducted by a stranger! They could, but why so much fear now when abductions are extremely rare, and crime is at a 50 year low?\n\nWUSSIFICATION: Trophies used to be an award for winning. Now, kids get a trophy just for showing up. Does this turn them into wimps? VICE co-founder Gavin McInnes says yes, because kids &quot;learning to lose, learning to fail&quot; is &quot;what childhood is all about.&quot; Parenting blogger Jenn-Anne Gledhill says, &quot;you call it wussification, I'm going to go ahead and call it a spiritual awakening.&quot;\n\nTHE TIGER-MOM: Western parents were shocked by Amy Chua's strict Chinese parenting methods: her daughters were forced to practice piano several hours every day; they couldn't have sleepovers or watch TV. Chua even called her own daughter &quot;garbage&quot; once. Is it too extreme? What do Chua's daughters say, now that they're older? We asked them if they even like their mom.\n\nGENDER NEUTRAL KIDS: Some parents say kids should choose if they want to be a boy or a girl. Dr. Leonard Sax says it's a grave mistake &quot;to put our heads in the sand and pretend that gender doesn't matter.&quot;\n\nDELAYED GRATIFICATION: Some psychologists say success on the famous marshmallow tests (can the child delay eating one, to get two treats 15 minutes later?) is the biggest predictor of success in kids' lives. Kids who can delay gratification do much better in life, get better grades in school, make more money, and are happier than those who can't.\n\n---------\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2014.11.22.SPECIAL.Grow.Up.Parenting.Wars.2014.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 351 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 193 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf54.63.104\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate                                 : 1 054 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.121\nStream size                              : 310 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ef024657e24553f8891ca8a00e190733b1370ee","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.11.22.SPECIAL.Grow.Up.Parenting.Wars.2014.WS.SDTV.x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ef024657e24553f8891ca8a00e190733b1370ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,240,36,101,126,36,85,63,136,145,202,138,0,225,144,115,59,19,112,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
