It also demonstrates how to solve the main process related problems that crop up in chemical engineering practice. The chapters are organized in a way that enables the students to acquire an in depth understanding of the subject. The emphasis is given to the units and conversions, basic concepts of calculations, material balance with or without chemical reactions and combustion of fuels and energy balances. Apart from numerous illustrations, the book contains numerous solved problems and exercises which bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical implementation. All the numerical problems are solved with block diagrams to reinforce the understanding of the concepts. Primarily intended as a text for the undergraduate students of chemical engineering, it will also be useful for other allied branches of chemical engineering such as polymer science and engineering and petroleum engineering. Key Features Methods of calculation for stoichiometric proportions with practical examples from the Industry. Simplified method of solving numerical problems under material balance with and without chemical reactions. Conversions of chemical engineering equations from one unit to another. Solution of fuel and combustion and energy balance problems using tabular column","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9466eb8173075f30f43224915603e58619779c49","amp;dn":"Chemical+Process+Calculations+-+D.+C.+Sikdar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9466eb8173075f30f43224915603e58619779c49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,102,235,129,115,7,95,48,244,50,36,145,86,3,229,134,25,119,156,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
