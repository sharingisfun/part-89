It is used for various applications, often involving the detection and identification of chemicals in a complex mixture. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry: Evaluation and Applications in Food Analysis presents a unique collection of up-to-date UPLC-MS/MS methods for the separation and quantitative determination of components, contaminants, vitamins, and aroma and flavor compounds in a wide variety of foods and food products.\n\nThe book begins with an overview of the history, principles, and advancement of chromatography. It discusses the use of UHPLC techniques in food metablomics, approaches for analysis of foodborne carcinogens, and details of UPLC-MS techniques used for the separation and determination of capsaicinoids. Chapters describe the analysis of contaminants in food, including pesticides, aflatoxin, perfluorochemicals, and acrylamide, as well as potentially carcinogenic heterocyclic amines in cooked foods.\n\nThe book covers food analysis for beneficial compounds, such as the determination of folate, vitamin content analysis, applications for avocado metabolite studies, virgin olive oil component analysis, lactose determination in milk, and analysis of minor components of cocoa and phenolic compounds in fruits and vegetables. With contributions by experts in interdisciplinary fields, this reference offers practical information for readers in research and development, production, and routing analysis of foods and food products","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9b80fe439089af7b9bacbdacc0605ec8262392","amp;dn":"Ultra+Performance+Liquid+Chromatography+Mass+Spectrometry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9b80fe439089af7b9bacbdacc0605ec8262392","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,155,128,254,67,144,137,175,123,155,172,189,172,192,96,94,200,38,35,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
