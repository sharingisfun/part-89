Ever.\n\nOnly ten minutes of it was worthwhile, the animated first appearance of Boba Fett.\n\nAnimated by Canadian studio Nelvana, the style was all 70s and awesome. Look out for the interesting inconsistency of how many fingers Boba Fett was drawn with.\n\nWhat I've uploaded was cropped (it was 4:3 ratio inside a 16:9 frame) with some contrast and vibrancy applied. Source material was a rip of special features from the Bluray collection.\n\nPlease seed this piece of pop culture history and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a38985dfbc86a879befca42125b63188c63a7c1","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Holiday+Special+-+Boba+Fett.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a38985dfbc86a879befca42125b63188c63a7c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,56,152,93,251,200,106,135,155,239,202,66,18,91,99,24,140,99,167,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
