These rhythms may be characterized by their intensive use of syncopation and polyrhythms. A common feature of breakbeats is its 'shuffling' hi-hats and its beat-skipping kick drums. Both meanings are closely connected to hip hop and b-boying (breakdance).&quot; - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakbeat\n\nIt's like that, and that's the way it is.\n\nFeel free to share both this Mixcloud stream as well as the YouTube video.\n\nEnjoy and thank you for listening!\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
