Before the 1997 retrocession to China, fears were widespread that the rights and freedoms enjoyed under colonial rule would be eroded, that the rule of law would be weakened and that corruption would increase. Soon, the first blows were struck against the rule of law via an NPCSC ruling which overturned the judgment of the Court of Final Appeal. Successive interventions by Beijing in Hong Kong's legal and political affairs have given rise to fears about the loss of the rule of law and loss of identity. These fears have subsequently provoked mass street demonstrations, including the 'Umbrella Revolution' of 2014. But, as this book shows, Hong Kongers also use less explicit arts of resistance to maintain their identity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f13debc0a309ef650fed0b5a6b3f3c87954a96","amp;dn":"Lost+in+China%3F%3A+Law+and+Identity+in+Post-1997+Hong+Kong%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f13debc0a309ef650fed0b5a6b3f3c87954a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,241,61,235,192,163,9,239,101,15,237,11,90,107,63,60,135,149,74,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
