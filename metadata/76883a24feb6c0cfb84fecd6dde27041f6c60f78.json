The 1st is the history of the sword and a whole lot more; the 3rd is absolutely everything there is to know about the different rays that were harvested for their skin and how those skins were used\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76883a24feb6c0cfb84fecd6dde27041f6c60f78","amp;dn":"Sword+and+Same+Book+by+Henri+Joly+1913%2C+republished+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76883a24feb6c0cfb84fecd6dde27041f6c60f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,136,58,36,254,182,192,207,184,79,236,214,221,226,112,65,246,198,15,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
