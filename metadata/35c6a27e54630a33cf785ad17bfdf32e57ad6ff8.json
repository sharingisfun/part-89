You will also need additional data files called &quot;SP-DATEN&quot; for communicating with the ECU. These will depend on your car and year. There are plenty of other torrents and websites describing this.\n\n\nGood luck!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35c6a27e54630a33cf785ad17bfdf32e57ad6ff8","amp;dn":"BMW+Standard+Tools+2.10.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35c6a27e54630a33cf785ad17bfdf32e57ad6ff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,198,162,126,84,99,10,51,207,120,90,209,123,253,243,46,87,173,111,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
