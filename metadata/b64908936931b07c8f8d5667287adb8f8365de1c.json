The music is composed almost entirely by Tsukasa Tawada, except for those adapted pieces that are originally from the previous GB games, who's composer is Junichi Masuda.\n\nIt took me a while to gather all of the audiofiles from various websites and available downloads to compile them into one complete set. It's new, so it needs seeders to help bring this file up to speed. Another place you can download it is through mediafire, but once you have it, please seed for the rest. This is a treasured work of art for the PokÃƒÂ©mon fans, new and old, which not only placed us in a new world seperate from the GB PokÃƒÂ©mon franchise, but still very much connected, with a new concept for the PokÃƒÂ©mon story and with creative musical pieces that have stuck with us for all these years, and will continue doing so if we all chip in and help out. So download it, enjoy it, and nurture it. Seed please!\n\nThere are overall 70 files, in order of the story, with exception of some sound effects that are added either by the story or as last bonus tracks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b64908936931b07c8f8d5667287adb8f8365de1c","amp;dn":"Tsukasa+Tawada+-+Pok%26eacute%3Bmon+Colosseum+Complete+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b64908936931b07c8f8d5667287adb8f8365de1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,73,8,147,105,49,176,124,143,141,86,103,40,122,219,143,131,101,222,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
