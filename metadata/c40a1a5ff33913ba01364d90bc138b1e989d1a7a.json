I started in Japan and lived in Kanagawa prefecture for two years. Since then I've been teaching in London and I regularly teach courses in business English, academic English, legal English, general English and English for exam courses like FCE, IELTS and BEC.\n\nI graduated from Liverpool John Moore's University in 1999 with a BA Hons degree in Media and Cultural Studies. I worked at various media production companies before going into English language teaching. I took my CELTA in 2001 and then my DELTA in 2006 at UCL. I now teach full time in a language school in London.\n\nI am a prolific writer of ELT materials, and I often design courses in EAP for which I usually write the material. I have written original courses for English for the Pharmaceutical Industry, English for the Oil and Gas Industries and English for Journalists. I am a semi-published author with some of my work being used in materials publications in several countries.\n\nI started Luke's English Podcast in 2009 and since then it has become enormously popular. I plan to continue writing material and publishing episodes of the podcast before hopefully publishing material of my own and expanding my website.\n\nI am also a musician and a comedian. I play drums and bass in several bands, and I regularly perform stand-up comedy in London. \n\nI sincerely hope you enjoy listening to Luke's English Podcast and that you find it improves your English. Check my other pages to find useful advice for learning English, and for how to use the podcast as a good way to improve your English in many areas.\n\n\nThanks for visiting the site!\n\nLuke\t\t\n\n\n\nEPISODE 282. Questions from Tea4er.ru\n\nIn this episode you can listen to an article about LEP and some Q&amp;A from readers of Tea4er.ru all read out by Luke. See below for the transcript. :)\n\nHi listeners,\n\nEarlier this year I was sent an email from one of the managers of a popular website in Russia for teachers of English. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called Tea4er.ru. Basically, the editor of this website approached me because some of their readers had mentioned me. He emailed me and asked me to provide an article explaining my approach to teaching English and how my podcast is part of that. The idea was that after reading the article, readers from the website could send me their questions. After a few weeks I would then read all those questions and choose a few to answer, then send my answers. The plan was that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d choose about 5 winning answers. In the end what happened was that there were so many questions that I found it almost impossible to just pick 5. There were over 20 pages of questions. I was totally blown away by the number of responses. Tea4er.ru is a hugely frequented site, and of course Russia is one of the biggest countries for LEP (in terms of website visits, Russia is #1 followed by Spain, UK, Poland, Italy, USA and Japan. For audio downloads my top country is by far the UK, followed by Russia, Spain, Poland and Japan) so that may explain why I got so many responses. I ended up responding to way more than 5 questions. I sent my responses to the website and they published them this week. With the permission of the website I have decided to turn the whole thing into an episode of LEP. I mean, I put so much time into writing the article and answering the questions that I thought it might be worth reading the whole thing out for my listeners to hear.\n\nSo thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to get in this episode. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll read you the article I wrote, which is basically the story of my career and of LEP, and then IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll read out the questions I was sent and my answers. The questions cover various topics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mainly English teaching, but also a whole bunch of other stuff. I hope you enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c40a1a5ff33913ba01364d90bc138b1e989d1a7a","amp;dn":"Luke%27s+ENGLISH+Podcast+%5B1-282%5D+%2B+A+Phrasal+Verb+%5B1-112%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c40a1a5ff33913ba01364d90bc138b1e989d1a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,10,26,95,243,57,19,186,1,54,77,144,188,19,139,30,152,157,26,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
