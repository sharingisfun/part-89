With this book as their guide, readers have the information and practical guidelines needed to select, operate, maintain, control, and troubleshoot process plant equipment so that it is efficient, cost-effective, and reliable throughout its lifetime. Following the authors' careful explanations and instructions, readers will find that they are better able to reduce downtime and unscheduled shutdowns, streamline operations, and maximize the service life of processing equipment.\n\nProcess Plant Equipment: Operation, Control, and Reliability is divided into three sections:\n\nSection One: Process Equipment Operations covers such key equipment as valves, pumps, cooling towers, conveyors, and storage tanks\nSection Two: Process Plant Reliability sets forth a variety of tested and proven tools and methods to assess and ensure the reliability and mechanical integrity of process equipment, including failure analysis, Fitness-for-Service assessment, engineering economics for chemical processes, and process component function and performance criteria\nSection Three: Process Measurement, Control, and Modeling examines flow meters, process control, and process modeling and simulation\nThroughout the book, numerous photos and diagrams illustrate the operation and control of key process equipment. There are also case studies demonstrating how actual process plants have implemented the tools and techniques discussed in the book. At the end of each chapter, an extensive list of references enables readers to explore each individual topic in greater depth.\n\nIn summary, this text offers students, process engineers, and plant managers the expertise and technical support needed to streamline and optimize the operation of process plant equipment, from its initial selection to operations to troubleshooting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c620ae8e022c7c00770ad89697137195e5473c0f","amp;dn":"Process+Plant+Equipment+-+Operation+Control+and+Reliability","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c620ae8e022c7c00770ad89697137195e5473c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,32,174,142,2,44,124,0,119,10,216,150,151,19,113,149,229,71,60,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
