The expert authors present everything from reactions without solvents to nanostructures for separation methods, from combinatorial chemistry on solid phase to dendrimers. The result is a ready reference packed full of valuable facts on the latest developments in the field - high-quality information otherwise widely spread throughout articles and reviews.\n\nFrom the contents:\n* Green chemistry for sustainable development\n* New synthetic methodologies and the demand for adequate separation processes\n* New developments in separation processes\n* Future trends and needs\n\nIt is a &quot;must-have&quot; for every researcher in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba4f0f55034e40353452b27e14a7be442b4d5c47","amp;dn":"Green+Separation+Processes+-+Fundamentals+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba4f0f55034e40353452b27e14a7be442b4d5c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,79,15,85,3,78,64,53,52,82,178,126,20,167,190,68,43,77,92,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
