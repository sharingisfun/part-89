Gene never sounded this spare -- they were a guitar band, after all -- and the unadorned instrumentation naturally forces attention on Rossiter's writing, particularly his lyrics. Always underappreciated during Gene's prime, Rossiter's lyrical skills have deepened with age, his pathos carrying a rich sense of irony and his humor as piercing as a stiletto. The same can't be said of his melodies, music that is gentle and lilting but never immediate; it feels like a soft bed for his words, but repeated listens reveal the structures, no matter how elliptical they may be. Yet that is the appeal of The Defenestration of St. Martin: it is pure artistic id, and after hearing it, it's possible to view Rossiter's entire body of work in a new light, gaining an appreciation for his grace, wit, and artistry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:845d234a962d33c621a61515e65b001f0a73dded","amp;dn":"Martin+Rossiter+-+The+Defenestration+of+St+Martin+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"845d234a962d33c621a61515e65b001f0a73dded","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,93,35,74,150,45,51,198,33,166,21,21,230,91,0,31,10,115,221,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
