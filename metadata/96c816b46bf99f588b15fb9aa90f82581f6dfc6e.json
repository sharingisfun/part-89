Conceptual design encompasses the generation of concepts and their integration into system-level solutions, leading to a relatively detailed design. This innovative text is devoted to the crucial initial design stage and focuses on parameter analysis. This methodology helps identify critical issues, or parameters, of the design and proposes configuration-specific solutions. The authors present real-world case studies. The book will appeal to engineering students, as well as to practicing engineers, architects, and product development managers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96c816b46bf99f588b15fb9aa90f82581f6dfc6e","amp;dn":"Innovative+Conceptual+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96c816b46bf99f588b15fb9aa90f82581f6dfc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,200,22,180,107,249,159,88,139,21,251,154,169,15,130,88,31,109,252,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
