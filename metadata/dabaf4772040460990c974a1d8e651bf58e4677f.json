However, as a one-stop shopping place for Hank's basic repertoire, 40 Greatest Hits is as good as it gets. While it doesn't include everything, practically every memorable hit is here, and thankfully every cut appears in its original form (that means in mono, with no string overdubs or artificial duets with his family members). The track sequence subtly reflects the arc of Williams' short but vitally important career, and there's enough good music and great songs here to make a fan of anyone with even a passing interest in American music. If you care about country music, you need some Hank Williams in your collection, and there isn't a better introduction to his rich body of work on the market than 40 Greatest Hits; begin here, then start exploring. \n\n\nGenre................: Country\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Polydor\nIncluded.............: Covers, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Move It On Over\n02.A Mansion On The Hill\n03.Lovesick Blues\n04.Wedding Bells\n05.Mind Your Own Business\n06.You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)\n07.Lost Highway\n08.My Bucket's Got A Hole In It\n09.I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\n10.I Just Don't Like This Kind Of Living\n11.Long Gone Lonesome Blues\n12.My Son Calls Another Man Daddy\n13.Why Don't You Love Me\n14.Why Should We Try Anymore\n15.They'll Never Take Her Love From Me\n16.Moanin' The Blues\n17.Nobody's Lonesome For Me\n18.Cold Cold Heart\n19.Dear John\n20.Howlin' At The Moon\n\nCD2\n\n01.I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)\n02.Hey Good Lookin'\n03.Crazy Heart\n04.(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle\n05.Baby, We're Really In Love\n06.Ramblin' Man\n07.Honky Tonk Blues\n08.I'm Sorry For You My Friend\n09.Half As Much\n10.Jambalaya (On The Bayou)\n11.Window Shopping\n12.Settin' The Woods On Fire\n13.You Win Again\n14.I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive\n15.Kaw-Liga\n16.Your Cheatin' Heart\n17.Take These Chains From My Heart\n18.I Won't Be Home No More\n19.Weary Blues From Waitin'\n20.I Saw The Light\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dabaf4772040460990c974a1d8e651bf58e4677f","amp;dn":"Hank+Williams+-+40+Greatest+Hits+%281989%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dabaf4772040460990c974a1d8e651bf58e4677f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,186,244,119,32,64,70,9,144,201,116,161,216,230,81,191,88,228,103,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
