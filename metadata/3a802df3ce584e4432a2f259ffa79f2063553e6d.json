Not just a music documentary, it's a snapshot of the city's vibrant independent music scene at its most intimate. Captured in a house that has long functioned as a hub for creativity in the city, it follows a cast of musicians and artists as they record a document of their own time. Bands fill every room in the house, from the bathroom to the attic. On-the-fly, direct and genuinely urgent, 6015 Willow follows twenty Halifax bands over three days, sweating buckets and blowing fuses.\n\n\n20 Bands.3 Days.1 House.\nProduced by Paul Hammond and Jeffrey Parker\nDirected by Mark Mullane\n\nThe Stolen Minks - Bring It\nDie Brucke - Who Gets The Kids?\nThe Holy Shroud - Clear The Room\nThe Medium Mood - All The Names\nThe Got To Get Got - War Of Letters\nThe Memories Attack - End It All\nA History Of - Low Level\nDog Day - Hammertown\nPlay Guitar - Sunrise,At Dawn\nThe Hold - Meet At The Lake\nPrisoners - I'm Like,A Wreck\nNorth Of America - Voting No\nOV Gramme - Untitled\nThe Just Barelys - Lions\nTomcat Combat - Pacer's Club\nThe Maynards - In The CIA\nThe Superfanatics - Tonight,Tonite\nWindom Earle - Kitten Vs.
