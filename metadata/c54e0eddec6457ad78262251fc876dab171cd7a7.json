He assesses how the wars have torn apart the fabric of Chechen society and their impact on Russia itself, where they have influenced presidential elections and widened the gulf between the military and the rest of society. These were savage conflicts which combined at different times the characteristics of an imperial war, a civil war and a terrorist campaign. The rich tradition of banditry in Chechnya, exemplified by the disproportionately large numbers of Chechens in the Spetsnaz special forces, gave the conflict its particular character, as did the steady shift from the initial nationalism to being inspired by a wider Islamic jihad.\n\n\nBook Cover: https://img.bi/#/v7Wxjno!dth3wAuLrGUgArNLVwn9EsqA0F_yZwbcylCQ5d_i","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54e0eddec6457ad78262251fc876dab171cd7a7","amp;dn":"Russia%27s+Wars+in+Chechnya+1994-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54e0eddec6457ad78262251fc876dab171cd7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,78,14,221,236,100,87,173,120,38,34,81,252,135,109,171,23,28,215,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
