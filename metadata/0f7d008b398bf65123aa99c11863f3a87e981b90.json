This will be their largest and most demanding job yet and they need all hands on deck to create the nine-room, interactive journey that takes visitors through the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outrageous 200-year-old history featuring a plague room complete with model cadavers and a torture chair designed to scare the wits out of the guests. Plus they will be introduced to characters such as James Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShanghaiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kelly and Miss Piggott, from the famed Miss PiggottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Saloon. The guys then rush off to Huntsville, AL, where they install a 3,000-year-old timeline log at a wild animal park belonging to a local eccentric.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f7d008b398bf65123aa99c11863f3a87e981b90","amp;dn":"Redwood.Kings.S01E05.San.Francisco.Dungeon.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f7d008b398bf65123aa99c11863f3a87e981b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,125,0,139,57,139,246,81,35,170,153,193,24,99,243,168,126,152,27,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
