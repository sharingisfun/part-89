The Sleuth Sisters [The Sleuth Sisters, #1] - Maggie Pill\n\n\nRecently unemployed, Faye Burner talks her retired sister Barbara into opening a detective agency. Their first few months are disappointing, since no one in their small Michigan town believes two fifty-something women can (or should) be private investigators. Faye wants to ask their well-connected sister Retta for help, but Barb insists she's too bossy to be included in the business. Without telling Barb, Faye lets Retta in on some details when they get their first real case: locating a man accused of murdering his wife and brother-in-law. Retta is helpful, as Faye knew she would be, but since she and Barb are both interested in the town's handsome new police chief, things become uncomfortable when they're all in the same room. When the sisters find the man they're looking for, bad things begin to happen, escalating from scare tactics to assault to murder. Someone doesn't want the old case stirred up, and that person is willing to kill. If the three Sleuth Sisters don't learn to work together, they'll be less one sibling!\n\n\n\n02. 3 Sleuths, 2 Dogs, 1 Murder (The Sleuth Sisters, #2) - Maggie Pill\n\n\n\nWhen RettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“gentleman friendÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is accused of murder, the Sleuth Sisters take on the case. Winston Darrow is a charmer, but his secrets create trouble that spills onto Retta, Barb, Faye, and even police chief Rory Neuencamp. Someone is out to get Win, someone he claims is the real killer. While Retta admits Win is less trustworthy than her daffy Newfoundland dog, she insists heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a murderer.\n\nDogs become an issue when Faye rescues a mutt she finds hurt on the road. Though Barb isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a fan, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t refuse FayeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s request to keep the homely, ill-tempered Buddy. Retta, though doubtful about adopting strays, is determined that FayeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dog and her Styx will be great friends. The adjustment isn't easy, since Buddy sees Faye as the only worthwhile being in the world.\n\nAs the sisters conduct their investigation, mysterious men interfere, each more threatening than the last. What do they want with themÃ¢â‚¬â€and with Winston?\n\nWhen the situation turns dangerous, the sleuths hide Win at RoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cabin, reachable in a Michigan winter only by snowmobile. In the frozen wilderness, Barb and Retta must ignore their differences and work together to stay alive. Back at home, Faye faces a deadly enemy with only Buddy and a couple of horses for backup.\n\nIf the Sleuth Sisters live through this, it will be due to family solidarity, doggie instincts, and loyal friends. But really, who would ask for more?\n\n03. Murder in The Boonies [The Sleuth Sisters, #3] - Maggie Pill\n\n\n\nRenters who lived on the sisters' family farm move out abruptly, and it seems that at least some of them didn't go voluntarily. Now the sisters are stuck with a menagerie to care for and a mystery to solve. What happened to Ben McAdams, his girlfriend Rose, and her three daughters? Why are mysterious people hanging around the farm? And what exactly to reindeer eat?\n\nThe investigation develops along with plans that please Faye's animal-loving heart. Making the best of things, she turns the farm into a horse retirement home. Still, there are those threatening figures hanging around, and details of a looming disaster emerge. On Michigan's beautiful Mackinac Island, the sisters must work together, face their fears, and foil a plot that only they can stop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9e1ba52c6d9c2fa8dfd87932473bb54cc69c12","amp;dn":"The+Sleuth+Sisters+Mystery+Series+-+Maggie+Pill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9e1ba52c6d9c2fa8dfd87932473bb54cc69c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,158,27,165,44,109,156,47,168,223,216,121,50,71,59,181,76,198,156,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
