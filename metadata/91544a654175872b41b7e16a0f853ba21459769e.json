This is a story-driven survival game where the aim is to find other survivors, gain their respect, and build a community. \n\nYou'll have to maintain a steady insulin supply for a diabetic woman, solve the mystery of why certain people have disappeared from a nearby community, and search for a truck full of stolen gold bullion that will make you unimaginably wealthy in the new gold-based economy. You'll scavenge for supplies, trade, plant crops, go on quests, face moral dilemmas, go to war, and uncover dark, terrible secrets! Or you could just kill everyone you meet, it probably won't get you very far but the choice is yours. \n\nThis game is already available on Desura and XBox 360. There is a free trial version that allows you to play for 30 minutes (1 day in game time) on Desura. The full game generally takes about 15-20 hours to play through if you do all the quests","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91544a654175872b41b7e16a0f853ba21459769e","amp;dn":"Survivalist.v33.8-ALI213","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91544a654175872b41b7e16a0f853ba21459769e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,84,74,101,65,117,135,43,65,183,225,106,15,133,59,162,20,89,118,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
