Riding High\n-------------------------------\n**320 KBPS CBR\n**Cover Art\n-------------------------------  \nMoxy is a Canadian hard rock and heavy metal band, formed in Toronto, Ontario, in 1974, from previous members of the rock group Leigh Ashford Ã¢â‚¬â€ which included singer Douglas &quot;Buzz&quot; Shearman (former teen singer of Sherman &amp; Peabody), alongside Greg Godovitz of Fludd &amp; Goddo, and Gil Moore (later of Triumph), Earl Johnson (former member of King Biscuit Boy), Bill Wade (former member of Outlaw Music and Brutus under the alias Hally Hunter that also included Gino Scarpelli of Goddo) and Terry Juric, (former member of Outlaw Music) as Leigh Ashford.[2] The group changed its name to Moxy in late 1974. This name change was accompanied by a change in the group's sound. Buddy Caine, a former band mate of Earl Johnson, was added to the group in 1975.\n\nMoxy toured extensively in Canada before having a hit in late 1975 with &quot;Can't You See I'm A Star&quot;. Moxy then toured the United States on the strength of their radio airplay. Markets in which the band was very popular included Ontario, Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, and San Antonio. Joe Anthony, the Godfather of Rock in San Antonio on KISS-FM was largely responsible for the popularity of the band in south Texas and helped bring about their first headline appearance in the U.S in 1977, appearing with AC/DC as their opening act.\n\nDespite the death of Joe Anthony, the Moxy/Texas connection has continued into the present with Moxy's hits like &quot;Can't You See I'm A Star&quot;, &quot;Moon Rider&quot;, and &quot;Sail On Sail Away&quot;. &quot;Midnight Flight&quot;, &quot;I'll Set You on Fire&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready&quot; still on the daily rotation at many Texas radio stations.\n\nMany of the guitar solos on the band's debut album were performed by guest session musician Tommy Bolin, who had previously been the lead guitarist for The James Gang and later replaced Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------\nOriginal members:\n-----------------\n\nBuzz Shearman: vocals (1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1977), (1979Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983)\nEarl Johnson: guitar (1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1978) (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nBill Wade: drums (1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1978), (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2000)\nTerry Juric: bass guitar (1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983)\nBuddy Caine: guitar (1975Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983), (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008)\n\nNote: Buddy Caine is listed on the album Moxy, but did not join the band until after the album was finished.\n\n--------------\nOther members:\n--------------\nTommy Bolin: (1975) guitar solos: studio only Moxy I\nTom Stephenson: keyboards: studio only Moxy I (Bolin's keyboardist) (1975)\nMike Reno: vocals (1978) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then Loverboy\nDanny Bilan: drums (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then Wild T and the Spirit\nScott &quot;Professor Piano&quot; Cushnie: keyboards (1978)\nWoody West: guitar (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1979) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from The Stampeders and &quot;Brutus&quot;\nDoug MacAskill: guitar (1979Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1983) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from The Stampeders then The Arrows\nBrian Maxim: vocals (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from &quot;Stumbling Blind&quot; and &quot;A Passing Fancy&quot;\nAlex Machin: vocals (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from &quot;Island&quot; then A Foot in Coldwater then &quot;Champion&quot;\nJim Samson: bass (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2013) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Zon\nKim Hunt: drums (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2013) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Island Zon then &quot;Urgent&quot;\nRussell Graham: vocals (2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2013) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Killer Dwarfs then &quot;Penny Black&quot; then &quot;Hard Road&quot;\nAndy Narsingh: Bass/Backing Vocals (2013) Heavens Fire/Juggernaut\nAlexis Von Kraven: Drums (2013) - from Exorcism/Metal Machine\nMike Cotton : Drums (2014-Present)\nRob Robbins: Guitar/Backing Vocals (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œPresent) - from Steel Lily\nNicholas Walsh: Vocals (2013Ã¢â‚¬â€œPresent) - from Slik Toxik,Famous Underground\nOscar Anesetti: Bass/Backing Vocals (2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) from The Rabid Whole","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b632f08772e77ff649cf0c92c86d8f8650f5ff44","amp;dn":"Moxy%2F40+Years+And+Still+Riding+High+%5B1974-2014%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b632f08772e77ff649cf0c92c86d8f8650f5ff44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,50,240,135,114,231,127,246,73,207,12,146,200,109,143,134,80,245,255,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
