This book can be used as a quick reference guide to the different disciplines of Chemistry: the areas covered are General, Inorganic, Organic, and Instrumental Analysis. Although comprehensive in nature, Basic Training in Chemistry is not meant to replace any standard textbook but rather to be a supplement or additional source of information, or even a comprehensive review guide. \nBasic Training in Chemistry is a useful addition to any academic or commercial laboratory setting where access to a wide variety of information is needed. The book can be an exceptional source of information for the undergraduate or graduate student as well as for the experienced chemist. Anyone needing a single source of information covering several different disciplines will find this book to be an excellent addition to their usual references","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1450360cb7744b8e71aad87a20d6fa9f4a90a19","amp;dn":"Basic+Training+in+Chemistry+-+Steven+L.+Hoenig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1450360cb7744b8e71aad87a20d6fa9f4a90a19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,69,3,96,203,119,68,184,231,26,173,135,162,13,111,169,244,169,10,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
