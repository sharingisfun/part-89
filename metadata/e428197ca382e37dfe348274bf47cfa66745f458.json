The set list includes many of Eilen's originals as well as select covers and a new song titled Rio Grande. The past year has been one of reflection and incredible output for Eilen. The singer-songwriter gave birth to a beautiful girl named Mavis (after gospel great Mavis Staples). Jewell squeezed in a few tours in 2014 and somehow found time to honor a frequent request from fans to release a live album. The two disc set, titled Live at the Narrows, includes original songs and some of her favorite covers. This special self-release was recorded over two evenings in early 2014 and features artwork hand drawn by her bass player Johnny Sciascia.\n\nEilen Jewell is the queen of the minor key. Sad songs are her wealth and finery. The Idaho nativeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique originals feature a blend of influences from early blues, rockabilly and surf-noir, to 1960s era rock and roll. The Los Angeles Daily News wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes as darkly damaged as Lucinda Williams, at others as defiant and teasing as prime Peggy Lee and always authentically Americana in the Gillian Welch traditionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mighty good.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Word in the UK described Jewell as Ã¢â‚¬Å“A voice of real distinction [that] manages to transcend some powerful influences and pierce the fog long enough for her own point of view to emerge.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nShe and her band tour relentlessly, regularly selling out venues around the world. JewellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tour dates span from North America to Western Europe, New Zealand and Australia. She has shared the stage with Lucinda Williams, Mavis Staples, George Jones, Emmylou Harris, Blind Boys of Alabama, Chris Smither, and Junior Brown. EilenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music has been heard on NPR, XM-Sirius, and the BBC. She has also received airplay in Canada, Australia, Spain, Holland, and Germany. TV shows Sons of Anarchy and True Blood have featured EilenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music as well as commercials such as T-MobileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fast Songs national TV campaign. Hollywood stars (Tom Hanks in Entertainment Weekly) to heads of state (British Prime Minister David Cameron in BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Telegraph) have praised EilenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music in the press.\n\nCD1\n01 - Where They Never Say Your Name\n02 - Sea Of Tears\n03 - Bang Bang Bang\n04 - Dusty Boxcar Wall\n05 - Reckless\n06 - Too Hot To Sleep\n07 - Rich Man's World\n08 - Mess Around\n09 - Santa Fe\n10 - Rio Grande\n11 - Rain Roll In\n12 - High Shelf Booze\n13 - In The End\n14 - Warning Signs\n\nCD2\n01 - I Remember You\n02 - Heartache Boulevard\n03 - Back To Dallas\n04 - Why I'm Walkin'\n05 - Sweet Rose\n06 - Blue Highway\n07 - Drop Down Daddy\n08 - Boundary County\n09 - Everywhere I Go\n10 - Fading Memory\n11 - Head Over Heels\n12 - The Flood\n13 - Thanks A Lot\n14 - If You Catch Me Stealing\n15 - Shakin' All Over\n\n*2014 Eilen Jewell - Self-Released\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e428197ca382e37dfe348274bf47cfa66745f458","amp;dn":"Eilen+Jewell+-+Live+At+The+Narrows+%282014%29+%5B2CD%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e428197ca382e37dfe348274bf47cfa66745f458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,40,25,124,163,130,227,125,254,52,130,116,191,71,207,166,103,69,244,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
