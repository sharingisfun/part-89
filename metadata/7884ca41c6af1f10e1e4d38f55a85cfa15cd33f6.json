This book draws on 25 years of design engineering experience from the author to provide you with a roadmap to understanding the design process, the elements of a successful project, the specific issues to address in a well-designed I&amp;C system, and the engineering products that enable practical design and successful maintenance. As nearly $65 billion worth of automation systems near the end of their traditional life cycle, the necessity of understanding the design process has never been more critical to engineers, technicians, and management - this book will help you achieve that understanding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7884ca41c6af1f10e1e4d38f55a85cfa15cd33f6","amp;dn":"Successful+Instrumentation+And+Control+Systems+Design+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7884ca41c6af1f10e1e4d38f55a85cfa15cd33f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,132,202,65,198,175,31,16,225,228,211,143,85,168,92,250,21,205,51,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
