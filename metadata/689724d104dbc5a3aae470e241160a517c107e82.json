In fields such as intelligence or undercover\npolice operations, the ability to lie with a straight face or engender trust for the explicit purpose of betraying it are essential\nprofessional skills that help disrupt and deter the worst sorts of predation, violence and corruption. This article is written for\nprofessionals in those and related fields who seek to conduct more effective influence operations with greater safety and\npredictability, in much the same way that proficiency at killing allows soldiers to conduct war in the same manner. While\ndistasteful to the layman, the concepts and assertions herein are presented in the most unvarnished of tone to most directly address\nthe reality of this work. Practitioners responsible for the fight against terrorist and violent criminal organizations should leverage\nany and every available resource to protect the citizens of their nation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689724d104dbc5a3aae470e241160a517c107e82","amp;dn":"Transmedia-Based+Influence+Operations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689724d104dbc5a3aae470e241160a517c107e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,151,36,209,4,219,197,163,170,228,112,226,65,22,10,81,124,16,126,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
