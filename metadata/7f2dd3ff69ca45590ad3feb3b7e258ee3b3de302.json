Twelve songs, twelve little musical pearls. One would never repeat enough that half of the success of a singer depends on the members of the band playing in the recording. In ELITE HOTEL, the Angel Band hides such great names as Glen D. Hardin at the piano, James Burton at the electric guitar or Herb Pedersen at the banjo. Some of you certainly remember that Glen D. Hardin and James Burton used to play with another successful singer : Elvis Presley...\n\nTwelve musical pearls because, like in PIECES OF THE SKY, Emmylou gives to the musicians the opportunity to develop superb instrumental solos. In my opinion, Buck Owen's &quot; Together Again &quot; can be compared to Ray Charles's version partly thanks to the incredible piano arrangement invented by Glen D. Hardin. The supporting vocals are also terrific, specially in Gram Parson's &quot; Sin City &quot; , John Starling forming with Emmylou a duo that has haunted me for days.\n\nThree songs recorded live &quot; Ooh Las Vegas &quot;, &quot; Sweet Dreams &quot; and Hank Williams's &quot; Jambalaya &quot; and an homage to Emmylou Harris's former mentor Gram Parsons with &quot; Sin City &quot;, &quot; Ooh Las Vegas &quot; and &quot; Wheels &quot;. At last, a perfect version of Lennon/McCartney's &quot; Here, there and everywhere &quot; that is going to make you wonder why this song is not one of the most known recording of the Beatles.\nA CD for your library.[/quote]\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/06/19/Foldera2843.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Emmylou Harris - Elite Hotel (Reprise 2286)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Emmylou Harris\nAlbum................: Elite Hotel (Reprise 2286)\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1975 12\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 47 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size. If you love \nFLAC then you'll know MP3 V0 is your other buddy for going mobile when \nspace and quality are a concern\n\nThe AccurateRip data is embedded in the MP3 tags so you can look at any \ntrack to validate the accuracy of the rip.\n\n- Big Papi\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f2dd3ff69ca45590ad3feb3b7e258ee3b3de302","amp;dn":"Emmylou+Harris+-+Elite+Hotel+%28Reprise+2286%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f2dd3ff69ca45590ad3feb3b7e258ee3b3de302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,45,211,255,105,202,69,89,10,211,254,179,183,226,88,238,59,61,227,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
