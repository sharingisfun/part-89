But when things go terribly wrong on maneuvers, Kyle is mortally wounded and Max, traumatized by the loss of his best friend, is unable to remain in service. Sent stateside, the only human he seems willing to connect with is KyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teenage brother, Justin, so Max is saved when he is adopted by KyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family. But Justin has issues of his own, including living up to his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectations, and he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t interested in taking responsibility for his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troubled dog. However, Max may be JustinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only chance to discover what really happened to his brother that day on the front, and with the help of Carmen, a tough-talking young teen who has a way with dogs, Justin begins to appreciate his canine companion.\n\nDirector: Boaz Yakin\n\nWriters: Boaz Yakin, Sheldon Lettich\n\nActors: Josh Wiggins, Robbie Amell, Lauren Graham, Thomas Haden Church, Luke Kleintank\n\nGenre: Family, Action and Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d28dbeec3f833f0794cfc521275fd1770bb23480","amp;dn":"Max.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d28dbeec3f833f0794cfc521275fd1770bb23480","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,141,190,236,63,131,63,7,148,207,197,33,39,95,209,119,11,178,52,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
