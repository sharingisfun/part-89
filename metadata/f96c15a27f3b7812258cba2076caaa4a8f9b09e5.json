By bringing to light delightful mind-teasers, philosophical questions and intriguing politics in mainstream economics, it promises to enliven an otherwise dry course whilst inspiring students to do well.\nThe book covers all the main economic concepts and addresses in detail three main areas:\n* consumption and choice\n* production and markets\n* government and the State.\nEach is discussed in terms of what the conventional textbook says, how these ideas developed in historical and philosophical terms and whether or not they make sense. Assumptions about economics as a discipline are challenged, and several pertinent students' anxieties ('Should I be studying economics?') are discussed.\n---------- ---------  --------      -------      ----    --     -      -      =\n\nthanks control+c                   READ THIS BOOK OVER &amp;OVER&amp; OVER * UnDeR\n\n__Please___ check my account as there is more by Yanis Varoufakis there, including the MOST recent published edition of the Global Minotaur (2015)\n\nlove y'all\n\n                       heli     i     a ru yy          u r a         i i le   h","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96c15a27f3b7812258cba2076caaa4a8f9b09e5","amp;dn":"Foundations+of+Economics+.+Yanis+Varoufakis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96c15a27f3b7812258cba2076caaa4a8f9b09e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,108,21,162,127,59,120,18,37,140,186,32,118,202,170,74,143,155,9,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
