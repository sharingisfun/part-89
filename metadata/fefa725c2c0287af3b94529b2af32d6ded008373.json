It was first published in Japan by Shueisha in 1999, serialized in the magazine Weekly ShÃ…ï¿½nen Jump. Zombiepowder. was later distributed in English by Viz Media. Although critical reception was largely mediocre, Zombiepowder. has achieved moderate commercial success in the United States due to the popularity of Tite Kubo's Bleach series.\n\nZombiepowder. follows a young boy named Elwood Shepherd and mysterious criminals Gamma Akutabi and C.T. Smith in their search for the Rings of the Dead, a group of legendary artifacts with the power to resurrect the departed and grant immortality to anyone who collects all 12 of them. The series has an anachronistic western setting, with sparsely populated human settlements separated by desert. The trio travel from town to town in this world, fighting other criminals for possession of the Rings of the Dead. They obtain three of said rings in the course of the story, but due to the series' cancellation, the plot is left incomplete as Kubo had a breakdown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefa725c2c0287af3b94529b2af32d6ded008373","amp;dn":"ZOMBIEPOWDER+%28v01+-+v04%29+%282006+-+2007%29+%28Digital%29+%28Lovag-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefa725c2c0287af3b94529b2af32d6ded008373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,250,114,92,44,2,135,175,59,148,82,155,42,243,45,109,237,0,131,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
