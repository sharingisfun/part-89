Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through AlaskaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ice. Thus was Dr. BlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.\n\nBut on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of downtown Seattle and unearthing a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who breathed it into the living dead.\n\nNow it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and toxic city. Just beyond it lives BlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. Until Ezekiel undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history.\n\nHis quest will take him under the wall and into a city teeming with ravenous undead, air pirates, criminal overlords, and heavily armed refugees. And only Briar can bring him out alive.\n\n\nRead by Kate Reading\nPublisher: Macmillan Audio; Unabridged edition (April 15, 2014)\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c239739e016d9421a49cbe63943d8ffbfbb2693","amp;dn":"Cherie+Priest+-+Boneshaker+%28The+Clockwork+Century+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c239739e016d9421a49cbe63943d8ffbfbb2693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,35,151,57,224,22,217,66,26,73,203,230,57,67,216,255,191,187,38,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
