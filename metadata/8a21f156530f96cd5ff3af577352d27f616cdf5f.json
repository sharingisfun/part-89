The story explored themes of family, sexual preference and aging in a humorous yet thought-provoking style.\n\nThe characters are all mentally deranged, but only aware of each others problems not their own.\n\nGeorge is a pompous academic who puts his obscure, pretentious and pointless pontificating above all else including his family. \nHe encourages Alex's snail obsession to get material for his books. \n\nBeverly, his sexually frustrated wife makes &quot;nice things&quot;, such as a 200ft tall &quot;family mug tree&quot;. In one episode she develops racial dysphoria, and starts painting her face with boot polish, believing that she is a black person trapped in a white body. \n\nTheir daughter Rose has her heart in the wrong place - jammed under her armpit. She runs a confectionery shop selling &quot;chocolate excretions&quot; and &quot;jelly war babies&quot;.\n\nThe humour is politely and subliminally obscene.\n\n\n\n\nCast:\nGeoffrey Palmer as George \nAngela Thorne as Beverly \nGerard Foster as Alex \nMiranda Hart as Rose \n\n\nWritten by Gerard Foster \n\nAt Home With The Snails - S01 - E01\nAt Home With The Snails - S01 - E02\nAt Home With The Snails - S01 - E03 \nAt Home With The Snails - S01 - E04 \n\nAt Home With The Snails - S02 - E01\nAt Home With The Snails - S02 - E02\nAt Home With The Snails - S02 - E03 \nAt Home With The Snails - S02 - E04\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 27mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\nÃ‚Â ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a21f156530f96cd5ff3af577352d27f616cdf5f","amp;dn":"At+Home+With+The+Snails+-+S01+%26amp%3B+02+-+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a21f156530f96cd5ff3af577352d27f616cdf5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,33,241,86,83,15,150,205,95,243,175,87,115,82,210,127,97,108,223,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
