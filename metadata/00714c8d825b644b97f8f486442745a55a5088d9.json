The original fileshare was 1.7 Gb.  The DVD is not available in US markets as NTSC.   Since it is a title which keeps getting hits, this version should appeal to those viewing on smaller screens.\n\n  There's a wiki for the film.  It indicates that Jean Crane did all her own swordplay for this production.\n\nSmaller file sizes encourage better sharing.  Once seeded I will keep this one going.\n\nNotes written May 2, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00714c8d825b644b97f8f486442745a55a5088d9","amp;dn":"Anne+of+the+Indies+%281951%29+starring+Jean+Peters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00714c8d825b644b97f8f486442745a55a5088d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,113,76,141,130,91,100,75,151,248,244,134,68,39,69,165,90,80,136,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
