She takes refuge in a place where even the smallest sliver of light does not dare to enter. Though she had to flee, she has not given up on the treasure she wishes to acquire. Her depravity knows no bounds; she's even willing to search for the one who can assist her in opening a Veil that has not been opened in millennia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with good reason: the danger is incalculable.\nMeanwhile, there are major changes rippling through the Romanian Grey wolves. Decebel has become Alpha to the Serbian pack in an effort to begin to unite the Canis lupis species. Their numbers are dwindling in the wake of the shortage of true mates and lack of offspring. The wolves are beginning to lose faith and darkness seems to be crashing in on them from all sides. But the winds of change are blowing, changes that will alter the future of not only the Canis lupis, but of another ancient race as well.\nAmidst all of this, Sally is continuing to come to terms with her relationship with the playful, charming, flirty, unbelievably handsome bartender Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who happens to be a member of the Romanian pack. \nIf all that weren't enough, the Fates have decided to pay a little visit to Jen. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to collect. She cheated the Fates of a life, her life. Now they want what they are due. The problem? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than Jen is willing to pay.\nYes, the war is indeed far from over. Bargains will be struck, declarations will be made, sacrifices will be given, love will be tested, and trust will be questioned as evil makes its stand against them all.[/color]\n\n[color=purple]IF YOU LIKE IT THEN SAY THANK YOU.\nPLEASE CONTINUOUS TO SEED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.Thank you[/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40184692ba82122fac4b2d6ecc59db7943f95088","amp;dn":"Beyond+the+Veil+%28Grey+Wolves%29+%7BZ00Z33%7D+%7Bepub%2Cmobi%2Cazw3%2Cpdf%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40184692ba82122fac4b2d6ecc59db7943f95088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,24,70,146,186,130,18,47,172,75,45,110,204,89,219,121,67,249,80,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
