Located near VirginiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s southern border, Lorwich was a flourishing industrial town with a bustling business generated by the local mines. Those prosperous days came to an end when a flood devastated the mining facility, leaving behind nothing but destruction in its wake. The disaster forced an immediate evacuation, leaving the town desolate. It has been years since the accident, and the town has long been forgotten.\n\nThe cause of the accident is still a mystery and, years later, nobody dares to step a foot in the town for fear of what lies there. There have been numerous reports of strange creatures and a dark, brooding fog within the town. Some locals who believe in the supernatural say that there lurks an ever-present force known as The Darkness. The Darkness is said to envelop everything in its path, and can reveal itself in many ways, such as fog, apparitions, and creatures.\n\n\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:580bd6cb988a98fa03b46d0b66caad6603c723c7","amp;dn":"AloneInTheDark_Illumination.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"580bd6cb988a98fa03b46d0b66caad6603c723c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,11,214,203,152,138,152,250,3,180,109,11,102,202,173,102,3,199,35,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
