Conducted and arranged by Montana, THE SALSOUL ORCHESTRA began an eight-year recording period in 1975 releasing eleven sensational albums during that time featuring production input from, Stan Lucas, Patrick Adams and Bunny Sigler through the years.\n\nRecorded at the famous Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, STREET SENSE was the first Salsoul Orchestra LP that Montana was not involved in, due to a dispute with the label. Legendary DJ and remixer Tom Moulton took on production duties with Salsoul stalwart Thor Baldursson arranging and conducting.\n\nStandout tracks include the opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœZambezi,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a driving, funky instrumental penned by Donny Hathaway and Richard Evans, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBurning Spear,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ another instrumental classic by Evans given the Salsoul treatment, title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœStreet Sense,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a full on dance track with an anthemic vocal chant and pulsing strings, and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ212 North 12th,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ a funky bass driven jam with great synth and strings. Closer Ã¢â‚¬ËœSun After The Rain,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ co-written by Bebu Silvetti and a worthwhile cover of Jefferson Airplane's Ã¢â‚¬ËœSomebody To LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ completes the set.\n\nThis newly remastered, fully expanded edition comes packaged complete with extensive liner notes and added bonus content making this BBR Remaster a must have for all Funk, Soul, Disco, R&amp;B and Philly Soul fans out there!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
