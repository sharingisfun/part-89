This\ndouble vinyl album contains 5 of his highly in demand exquisite productions\nand remixes, the compilation boasts timeless masterpieces including his\nremixes of Detroit Experiment ÃƒÂ¦Think Twice', Emmanuel Jal ÃƒÂ¦Kuar' and Omar\nfeat. Stevie Wonder ÃƒÂ¦I'm Feeling You', as well as his own ÃƒÂ¦Once Again' &amp; ÃƒÂ¦I\nExist Because Of You'.\n\nSchwarz's passion has always been the combination of electronic computer\nmusic with instruments and inspirations from other origin. Sound sources\nfrom outside the dance world have been melted together with mesmerizing\nelectronic synths and drum machines to create a blast of energy on the\ndancefloor and to open a space in your mind. Without question one of the\nmost devoted electronic artists of his time ÃƒÂ» and recently voted the 6th\nbest Live Act in the world by the readers of Resident Advisor ÃƒÂ» Schwarz is\nnow revered as a truly unique talent, a fact that is exemplified by one of\nthe strongest collections of music in the acclaimed House Masters series.\nÃƒÂ´I have felt total freedom in electronic music because the 4/4, for me, is\nthe bridge into the unknown in a way: you can do anything in between two\nbass drums, and they hold it together. You can do the craziest sound and\nput a bass drum there and everyone loves it.ÃƒÂ¶ Henrik Schwarz.\nHouse Masters Henrik Schwarz is a hand-picked selection of tracks and\nremixes from his peerless vault, with Schwarz given complete freedom to\ninclude those records he believes best represent his career in electronic\nmusic.\n\nUltimately, words can only do so much justice to music of this calibre, so\nif you're looking for the only definite collection from a master of his\ntrade you need look no further.\nHouse Masters Henrik Schwarz is the 20th edition in the long-running House\nMasters series which has seen releases celebrating the work of Louie Vega,\nDennis Ferrer, Charles Webster and many more\n\nenjoy excellent quality music and encoding FTW! :)\n\nremember to support artists.\n\n[respect]\n\nshoutouts to the groups that love the music they promote..\n\n[dh]\n\nIf you're down with the deep house music, music with feeling..\nmusic that makes you groove no matter where you are.. and you\nthink you can add to this feeling.. then drop us a line &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;dfbb80b79fa5b2beb6b3f1bcb0b2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nkeep the feeling real. .   d e e p h o u s e  2 0 1 5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dd22fc4397c2188a12fb1660531c7227150fa2a","amp;dn":"VA-Henrik_Schwarz_House_Masters-%28HOMAS20CD%29-2CD-2014-dh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dd22fc4397c2188a12fb1660531c7227150fa2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,210,47,196,57,124,33,136,161,47,177,102,5,49,199,34,113,80,250,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
