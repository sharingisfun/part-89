Thus we glimpse 11th century rural society through a conversation between a ploughman and his master. The life of Dick Whittington illuminates the rise of the urban elite. The stories of Roger Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe RakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ who drowned in his own sewage, a Ã¢â‚¬ËœmermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ imprisoned in Orford Castle and the sufferings of the Jews of Bristol reveal the extraordinary diversity of medieval society. Through these characters and events Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and using the latest discoveries and research - the dynamic and engaging panorama of medieval England is revealed. Interesting facts include: When the life expectancy for women dropped to 26 years in Sierra Leone in 2002, following a catastrophic civil war, it was one year longer than the estimate for early medieval women. So great was the extent of church construction in the thirteenth century that it has been calculated it was the equivalent, in modern terms, of every family in England paying Ã‚Â£500 every year, for the whole century! Murder rates for East Anglia, in the fourteenth century, were comparable with those of modern New York. For England generally the homicide rate was far higher than that of the urban USA today.\n\n.ePUB/.MOBI/.PDF/.TXT\n\nEnjoy!\nLibRARiuS\nOnly the educated are free...
