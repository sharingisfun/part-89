Kevin Skoglund explains the basic syntax of RSpec and then dives straight into writing and running test examples. He shows how to use a variety of matchers to test for expected conditions, provides techniques for testing efficiently, and demonstrates how test doubles can stand in for objects and methods. He also explains the additional RSpec features available for Ruby on Rails, and walks through a step-by-step example of test-driven development.\n\nLevel: Intermediate\nLength: 6h 14m\nReleased: February 4, 2015\n\nTopics include:\nInstalling and configuring RSpec\nWriting and running examples\nDefining expectations using matchers\nUsing helper methods, before/after hooks, and shared examples\nCreating test doubles using mocks and stubs\nTesting Ruby on Rails with RSpec\nPutting test-driven development into practice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd332df5452ada71751fb1c830523720c09b1db9","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+RSpec+Testing+Framework+with+Ruby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd332df5452ada71751fb1c830523720c09b1db9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,51,45,245,69,42,218,113,117,31,177,200,48,82,55,32,192,155,29,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
