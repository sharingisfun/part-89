In order to preserve its profundity, the musician is required to present it with a certain reverence and deliberateness. This prescription is confirmed by the raag's complex vakra [zigzag] phraseology, which would suffer a degree of &quot;flattening out&quot; at higher levels of swara-density.\nIt is performed very frequently across many gharanas and styles, with different genres of classical songs, like khayals, thumris, dhrupads, to dhamars, and semi-classical pieces, as well as light classical songs &amp; bhajans. It is characterized by its intoxicating and soothing melody.\nAt an another level, KedarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sanskrit meanings, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMountain LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœPowerfulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Many Muslims instinctively say Ã¢â‚¬ËœQadirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ instead of Ã¢â‚¬ËœKedarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Qadir is one of AllahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Names. There is a consonance - Qadir means Ã¢â‚¬ËœsamarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or One Who Can Do Anything. Another way of saying Ã¢â‚¬ËœPowerfulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Moreover, Kedar as the silent young ascetic connects with the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Fool on the Hill, who sees the world spinning round in total silence, who never seems to answer. But in his silence, he knows what he knows. He hears GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice. Many feel that Raag Kedar lets us hear it, too.\n\nKedar, which rejoices in the beautiful name Hamir Kalyani in the Carnatic system, is a profoundly abstract raag, not easily Ã¢â‚¬Å“visualisedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The medieval Raagmala paintings depict Kedar as a young ascetic Ã¢â‚¬Å“beauteous in every limbÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, his face luminous with a spiritual glow, his body smeared with ashes, doing penance before Shiva. Scholars would know better, but if ever a mudra assigns itself to Kedar it would be the Ã¢â‚¬Å“chhinn mudraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, of forefinger and thumb meeting to form a pointed antelopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head: The mudra of cosmic search frequently depicted on Sakyamuni by sculptors and painters.\nIt is generally accepted that there is much thermal energy in this melody and hence it is regarded as the Raagini of Raag Deepak.\n\nKedar is amongst the most popular post-sunset raags.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mio.to/album/Fahimuddin+Dagar/Raga+Kedar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mio.to/album/Fahimuddin+Dagar/Raga+Kedar&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d24be72b64d9ba6d99737d61492adfbcf89b455e","amp;dn":"Rahim+Fahimuddin+Dagar+-+Raga+Kedar+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d24be72b64d9ba6d99737d61492adfbcf89b455e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,75,231,43,100,217,186,109,153,115,125,97,73,42,223,188,248,155,69,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
