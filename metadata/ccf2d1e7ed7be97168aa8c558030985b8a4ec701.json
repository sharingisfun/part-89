His main goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he already has been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. One night when stopped at the town of Pasloe, he finds in his wagon a pagan wolf-deity named Holo who is over 600 years old. She appears to be a 15-year-old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest, who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Despite her responsibility to watch over the town, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu; she believes the people have already forsaken her and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. Holo wants also to travel to see how the world has changed while she has remained in one place for years. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the Church.\n\nVideo\nVideo Source: Blu ray\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\n\nAudio\nCodec: AC3\nTrack 1: English 5.1ch\nTrack 2: Japanese Stereo\n\nSubtitles\nEnglish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf2d1e7ed7be97168aa8c558030985b8a4ec701","amp;dn":"Spice+and+Wolf+S1%2CS2+%28BDRip+1920x1080p%29+Dual+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf2d1e7ed7be97168aa8c558030985b8a4ec701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,242,209,231,237,123,233,113,104,170,140,85,128,48,152,91,138,78,199,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
