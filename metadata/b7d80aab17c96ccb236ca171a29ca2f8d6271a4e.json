Assuming no prior knowledge of the subject, this text introduces all of the applied fundamentals of process control from instrumentation to process dynamics, PID loops and tuning, to distillation, multi-loop and plant-wide control. In addition, readers come away with a working knowledge of the three most popular dynamic simulation packages. The text carefully balances theory and practice by offering readings and lecture materials along with hands-on workshops that provide a 'virtual' process on which to experiment and from which to learn modern, real time control strategy development","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7d80aab17c96ccb236ca171a29ca2f8d6271a4e","amp;dn":"A+Real-Time+Approach+to+Process+Control+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7d80aab17c96ccb236ca171a29ca2f8d6271a4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,216,10,171,23,201,108,203,35,108,161,113,162,156,162,248,214,39,26,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
