This is the last album released before his death in 2003. The majority of songs are covers which Cash performs in his own spare style, with help from producer Rick Rubin. For instance, for the song &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, Rubin asked then-Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante to re-work an acoustic version of Martin Gore's song, which featured a simple acoustic riff that stripped down the song to a blues style. He receives backing vocal assistance from various artists, including Fiona Apple, Nick Cave, and Don Henley. American IV was the final Cash album released during his lifetime; though the Unearthed Box Set was compiled prior to his death, it was not released until two months later. It was also his first non-compilation album to go gold (selling over 500,000 copies) in thirty years. Additionally, the album won &quot;Album of the Year&quot; award at the 2003 CMA Awards. It was certified Gold on 4/24/2003 and Platinum on 11/21/2003 by the R.I.A.A.\n\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.The man comes around                                 [04:27]\n02.Hurt                                                 [03:39]\n03.Give my love to rose                                 [03:29]\n04.Bridge over troubled water (feat. fiona apple)       [03:55]\n05.I hung my head                                       [03:54]\n06.First time ever I saw your face                      [03:52]\n07.Personal jesus                                       [03:20]\n08.In my life                                           [02:58]\n09.Sam hall                                             [02:40]\n10.Danny boy                                            [03:20]\n11.Desperado (feat. don henley)                         [03:14]\n12.I'm so lonesome I could cry (feat. nick cave)        [03:03]\n13.Tear stained letter                                  [03:41]\n14.Streets of laredo                                    [03:33]\n15.We'll meet again                                     [02:59]\n________\n52:04 min\n 71,4 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
