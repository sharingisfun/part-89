Straight Ahead\n\n\nBy the beginning of the 1970s, Jimi Hendrix was unquestionably one of the most exciting rock musicians of his generation, having captivated the world with his highly stylized approach to blues guitar. In Electric Church, Paul McCartney freely admits to worshipping him, adding, &quot;We all played guitar. We all knew a bit. But he seemed to know more than us.&quot;\n\nJimi Hendrix put the rock festival concept on the map with his blistering performance at California's Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, headlining 1968's inaugural Miami Pop Festival, and providing the soundtrack for the counterculture with a dazzling set at Woodstock in 1969.\n\nHis performance at the Second Atlanta International Pop Festival was not only significant on a musical level, but also in terms of socio-political dynamics. The organizers were keen to push back against the cultural divide that was very much in evidence in the Deep South. It was assumed that rural audiences would not take kindly to &quot;long-hair&quot; bands, and that black and white artists could not comfortably exist on the same bill; Atlanta Pop set out to challenge those beliefs. Hendrix's music and message of universal love made him the ideal artist to represent that pushback, and, appropriately, was the first act booked for the festival","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baeaaf12e88146bdcf9ac032ae249d8bf01b74ae","amp;dn":"JIMI+HENDRIX+EXPERIENCE+-+Freedom%3A+Atlanta+Pop+Festival+%282015%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baeaaf12e88146bdcf9ac032ae249d8bf01b74ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,234,175,18,232,129,70,189,207,154,192,50,174,36,157,139,240,27,116,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
