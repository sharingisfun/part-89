This book captures the multidisciplinary nature of ferrocene research, including topics such as ferrocene-containing polymers, ferrocene-containing thermotropic liquid crystals, chiral ferrocene derivatives, and ferrocene-containing charge-transfer materials.\n\nIn addition, the reader will find\n\n* valuable information for planning syntheses\n* over 70 tables, making relevant data available at a glance * carefully selected references, providing an easy access to the primary literature\n\nUp-to-date, and written by leading international experts in the field, among them R. Deschenaux, C. D. Hall, Y. Butsugan, and R. Herrmann, this book is a welcome source of in-depth information for graduate students and professionals in organic, organometallic, and polymer chemistry, as well as in materials science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:993ea5332cfab8edc58ea5917635b4f3c1c95466","amp;dn":"Ferrocenes+-+Homogeneous+Catalysis%2C+Organic+Synthesis%2C+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"993ea5332cfab8edc58ea5917635b4f3c1c95466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,62,165,51,44,250,184,237,197,142,165,145,118,53,180,243,193,201,84,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
