As such, it covers all aspects from academia and industry in a clearly structured way. Leading experts provide the background information as an initial aid for newcomers to the field, while chapters on different reaction types and industrial applications make this an equally vital resource for specialists","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d17bb7542085ab29a7950119e1a2f4c647f55e3","amp;dn":"Microreactors+in+Organic+Synthesis+and+Catalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d17bb7542085ab29a7950119e1a2f4c647f55e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,23,187,117,66,8,90,178,154,121,80,17,158,26,47,76,100,127,85,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
