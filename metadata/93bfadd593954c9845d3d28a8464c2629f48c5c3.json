In early 2001, Capdown toured with a number of established American bands, including Less Than Jake and played the Deconstruction touring festival with Pennywise and Lagwagon. In September 2001, Capdown released their second album, Pound for the Sound, receiving positive reviews from the likes of Kerrang!. The following year saw tours with Bad Religion and Hundred Reasons.
