Before the Holy Prophet Muhammad's arrival, a woman was regarded as man's slave and property, and no religion or nation could offer the woman rights and freedom. When their husbands died, they were forced to marry relatives or sold for money. There was no law that could protect them.\n\nProphet Muhammad proclaimed in the name of God that men and women are equal. He declared that a man does not own his wife. He may not sell or force her into slavery. The teaching of the Holy Prophet raised the status of women as being not only equal to men, but also gave them freedom for social, physical and spiritual development.\n\nThis book is about women's rights and freedom in Islam and shows that Holy Prophet Muhammad was indeed the liberator of women.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam.
