Deeply in love with Portugal, he was an expert, critic and translator of the works of Fernando Pessoa from whom he drew the conceptions of saudade, of fiction and of the heteronyms. Tabucchi was first introduced to Pessoa's works in the 1960s when attending the Sorbonne. He was so charmed that, back in Italy, he attended a course of Portuguese language for a better comprehension of the poet.\n\nHis books and essays have been translated in 18 countries, including Japan. Together with his wife, MarÃƒÂ­a JosÃƒÂ© de Lancastre, he translated many works by Pessoa into Italian and has written a book of essays and a comedy about the writer. Tabucchi was awarded the French prize &quot;MÃƒÂ©dicis ÃƒÂ©tranger&quot; for Indian Nocturne (Notturno indiano) and the premio Campiello, and the Aristeion Prize for Sostiene Pereira. In later life he was mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, a feat he never achieved.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Indian Nocturne\n\n* Little Misunderstandings of No Importance\n\n* Pereira Maintains\n\n* The Flying Creatures of Fra Angelico\n\n* The Woman of Porto Pim\n\n* Time Ages in a Hurry\n \n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Tabucchi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Tabucchi&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/antonio-tabucchi-italys-master-mystical-prose-straddles-two-worlds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.italymagazine.com/featured-story/antonio-tabucchi-italys-master-mystical-prose-straddles-two-worlds&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f569b87d9676ef08a05f4f05ce35f55b62b521d9","amp;dn":"Antonio+Tabucchi+-+Novels+%26amp%3B+Short+Stories+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f569b87d9676ef08a05f4f05ce35f55b62b521d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,105,184,125,150,118,239,8,160,95,79,5,206,53,245,91,98,181,33,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
