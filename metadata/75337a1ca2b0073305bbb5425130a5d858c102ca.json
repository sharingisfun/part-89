All moments experienced and recorded at MCM Recording Studio, except 'The World I Left Behind' from L&amp;L Sound, Worcester, Massachusetts. \nMastered at Peerless Mastering, Newtonville, Massachusetts.\n\n\nIn some ways, Harvest of Dreams sounds rather like a philosophical precursor to Neutral Milk Hotel's In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. Both albums are dominated by the singer/songwriter's cryptic but clearly deeply personal lyrics, which resist easy explication but often startle with the disquieting intensity of their imagery. Trimble has a more objectively pretty voice than Jeff Mangum (a breathy high tenor with occasional echoes of both Sparks' Russell Mael and, no kidding, Joni Mitchell), but he's equally fond of obscuring his vocals with layers of echo, reverb, and other effects. Rather than the horns and strings that enrich In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, the songs on Harvest of Dreams are overlaid with found sounds and extraneous noises: video game soundtracks, telephone busy signals, snatches of conversation between the bandmembers, and other everyday sonic detritus further smudge the songs, which at root are based on Trimble's psych-folk guitar and plaintive vocals.\n\nFinally, both albums are somewhat perversely sequenced to some inscrutable structure: side one of Harvest of Dreams (subtitled Dimension One: Truth) is bracketed by &quot;Premonitions -- The Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Premonitions Boy -- The Reality,&quot; which turn out to be very slightly different remixes of exactly the same recording, and also features a track called &quot;The World I Left Behind,&quot; just over two minutes' worth of dead silence preceding the sonic onslaught of the mildly terrifying &quot;Armour of the Shroud.&quot; The cacophony overlaid onto this psychedelic rocker has led some armchair psychiatrists in the obscuro-pop underground to suggest that Trimble was schizophrenic, a rather facile reading unsupported by facts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75337a1ca2b0073305bbb5425130a5d858c102ca","amp;dn":"Bobb+Trimble+-+1982+-+Harvest+Of+Dreams+%282007%2C+Reissue%29+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75337a1ca2b0073305bbb5425130a5d858c102ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,51,122,28,162,176,7,51,5,187,181,66,81,48,165,216,88,193,2,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
