Other members of staff who appeared regularly were Mr Holliday, Beeston's deputy; Mrs Stone, the school secretary and resident oasis of calm; plain-speaking Mr Long and the utterly terrifying Mrs Rudd.\n\nCast:\nJames Grout as Mr Beeston, Headmaster\nPeter Davison as Eric Brown\nKarl Howman as Phillip Sims\nTom Watson as Mr. Holliday, Deputy Head\nMargaret John as Mrs. Stone, School Secretary\nVivienne Martin as Mrs. Rudd\nPaul Copley as Mr. Long\nMarlene Sidaway as Miss Lewis\nDeirdre Costello as Mrs. Patterson\n\n\n\nKing Street Junior -
