It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls action role-playing video game series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Three downloadable content (DLC) add-ons were releasedÃ¢â‚¬â€Dawnguard, Hearthfire and DragonbornÃ¢â‚¬â€which were repackaged into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition, which released on June 4, 2013.\n\nSkyrim's main story revolves around the player character's efforts to defeat Alduin, a Dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. Set two hundred years after Oblivion, the game takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops their character by improving their skills. Unlike previous Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim does not require the player to select a character class at the beginning of the game, negating a problem the development team felt previous entries had by forcing the player into a rigid play-style too early in the game. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.\n\nI wrote some real instructions to this file, and included a copy of the poweriso program that you can use to mount this with.\n\nThanks to the person I got this from, to EinDeutschMan who I got the poweriso from, to the people at Bethesda studios and to the people behind the scenes at ThePirateBay.\n\nEnjoy and please seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e286b2f1c736efb78287adfa193b59550feea7","amp;dn":"Skyrim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e286b2f1c736efb78287adfa193b59550feea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,226,134,178,241,199,54,239,183,130,135,173,250,25,59,89,85,15,238,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
