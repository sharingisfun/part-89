Applications to compilers, string searching, and control circuit design will be discussed. The hierarchy of finite state machines, pushdown machines, context free grammars and Turing machines will be analyzed, along with their variations. The notions of decidability, complexity theory and a complete discussion of NP-Complete problems round out the course.\n\nText: Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Michael Sipser.\n\nReference: Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation, Hopcroft, Motwani and Ullman.\n\nRequirements: Two exams, five problem sets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e404efaf7bfe4502857440c71a2e862d5c0a70b2","amp;dn":"Theory+Of+Computation+-+By+Shai+Simonson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e404efaf7bfe4502857440c71a2e862d5c0a70b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,4,239,175,123,254,69,2,133,116,64,199,26,46,134,45,92,10,112,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
