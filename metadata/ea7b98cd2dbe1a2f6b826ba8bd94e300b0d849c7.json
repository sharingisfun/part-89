Papalambros, Douglass J. Wilde (Cambridge University Press, 2000).pdf\n\nISBN 0521622158\n\nSince the first edition was published, computers have become ever more powerful, design engineers are tackling more complex systems, and the term &quot;optimization&quot; is now routinely used to denote a design process with increased speed and quality. This second edition takes account of these developments and brings the original text thoroughly up to date. The book now discusses trust region and convex approximation algorithms. A new chapter focuses on how to construct optimal design models. Three new case studies illustrate the creation of optimization models. The final chapter on optimization practice has been expanded to include computation of derivatives, interpretation of algorithmic results, and selection of algorithms and software","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea7b98cd2dbe1a2f6b826ba8bd94e300b0d849c7","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Optimal+Design+-+Modeling+and+Computation+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea7b98cd2dbe1a2f6b826ba8bd94e300b0d849c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,123,152,205,45,190,26,47,107,130,107,168,189,148,227,0,176,216,73,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
