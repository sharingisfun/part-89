All high quality error free rips with tags of sweetness.\n\nThis appears to be a release honoring his death which occurred Dec 17, 1999 but that is not clear.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\nBy John Jones\n\nOne of the founding fathers of the &quot;smooth jazz&quot; genre, pioneering the blending of jazz with pop and R&amp;B elements, Grover Wsahington consistently produced work of a high order: strong choice in material, enticing arrangements, and rich, soulful saxophone work. This collection sums up twelve years with Columbia Records neatly but thoroughlly.\n\nHis takes on classics were always exciting, and Washington breathing new life into Dave Brubeck's &quot;Take Five&quot; and the standard &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love&quot; are no exceptions. But even the newer compositions sounded timeless, whether it was the sensual rhythmic vibe of &quot;Only for You (Siempre Para Ti Sere),&quot; the head-bobbing infectiousness of &quot;Soulful Strut,&quot; or the sheer beauty of &quot;Strawberry Moon,&quot; a gorgeous composition that has rightfully established itself as a classic smooth jazz cut. And then there's &quot;Sacred Kind of Love,&quot; a duet with Phyllis Hyman that is the epitome of bittersweet: it's hard not to wonder, a bit sadly, what Washington and Hyman might have stood to accomplish if they were alive today. Still, hearing them pair up at the height of their artistry is a priceless thrill.\n\nThrow in two tracks recorded especially for this collection before Grover's untimely passing (the slick and inviting &quot;Heat Index&quot; and &quot;The Night Fantastic&quot;) and you have a satisfying compilation of one of jazz's most beloved saxophonists. If soul and technique are the meat of musical recordings, these are prime cuts indeed.\n\n\nimage\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nGrover Washington, Jr. - Prime Cuts: The Greatest Hits 1987-1999\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Grover Washington, Jr.\nAlbum................: Prime Cuts: The Greatest Hits 1987-1999\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1999\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: , ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: on 1/31/2015\nPosted by............: on 1/31/2015\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
