Ant addresses the belligerence on-line as well as on-line ball washers and ball busters, tells us his take on Trump running for president, calls out Hillary, goes through some presidential logos, and then plays a joyous video of a car accident and one of drunkards in Chicago. Ant moves to the poker table to talk with Sherrod Small and Kurt Metzger about the recent Seinfeld articles, on-line hate being more aggressive than in-person hate, Rachel Dolezal racially generalizing her look, privilege in races, and they debate the logic Dolezal has in general. They guys then talk about Ã¢â‚¬Å“mattress girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the bullshit behind some stats, the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“rape,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ raping, stigmas with rape, rapity rape rape, crying rape, and then get off rape and on to Jay OakersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s upcoming roast where Joe DeRosa will also be in attendance. They chat about siccing their fans on assholes, reading audiences, the media and bloggers destroying everything, the change in audience reaction due to fear, nerd power, propaganda, attention spans being shorter, and the pros and cons of social media. The guys go into overtime talking about Chyna and X-Pac on Opie and JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show, a Pittsburgh bus slogan getting axed, we get a lesson on how the Vietnamese got the name Ã¢â‚¬Å“Charlie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ hear about past treatment of soldiers in reality vs. in movies, the government shielding images, Colin QuinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new book, Matt LauerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interview with Rachel Dolezal, and get the truth about tipping. Ant tries to explain dick spray to the guys, Kurt talks about his interview on Inside Amy, KurtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girlfriend Karen joins to the boys to talk about her open relationship with him, and Ant reminisces about past threesomes and exes.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d47acb327e73601dc75018a9fdb823d4607572a","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-06-16+with+Race+Wars+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d47acb327e73601dc75018a9fdb823d4607572a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,71,172,179,39,231,54,1,220,117,1,138,159,219,130,61,70,7,87,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
