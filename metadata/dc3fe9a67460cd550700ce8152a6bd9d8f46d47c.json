Couldn't find it on any torrent site, but found it somewhere in MP3. If someone has a better quality copy, please upload or comment!\n\nOh, and let's keep this one alive by seeding for some time. My connection is not that great, so it might go down once in a while (if it's all up to me)...\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCarlisleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Lucid Dream formed way back in 2008, giving their long-awaited debut album plenty to live up to. Songs Of Lies And Deceit gives a home to two sold out 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ singles (Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove In My VeinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeartbreak GirlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) as well as a heck of a lot more songs of tinnitus-tempting jangling guitars smothered in delicious reverb. Confrontational, yes, but thankfully the time the Cumbria lads took to create it was also well spent Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amongst the best psychedelic rock trips of 2013.\n\nWith jagged guitars echoing like thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no tomorrow, gushes of white noise and forever oscillating bass lines everywhere, The Lucid DreamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival is a high akin to soaring through a void. Distorted vocals are another constant, being a major highlight in opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœHowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Your Low When YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Low Alone?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a six minute frenzy thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followed by Ã¢â‚¬ËœGlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s display of appreciation towards Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fixing you into a paralytic state of nirvana.\n\nThat aforementioned pair of singles along with Ã¢â‚¬ËœIn Your EyesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ show a much more garage-rock based side to the Northern quartet. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a clear 60s guitar-driven influence from the likes of The Rolling Stones and The 13th Floor Elevators on show, to an Indian-styled sound evident in Ã¢â‚¬ËœHeading For The WavesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with ringing guitars that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help but recall The Beatles.  Obvious touch points, sure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but faultless ones too, as is this more up-to-date source of inspiration; as you reach the climactic three songs, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as if Reni from The Stone Roses has sat down behind the drums, rhythms being delivered with a new power and soul.  Here, Luke Anderson attacks the skins frantically, combining with some hazy vocal hooks to make a truly fantastic piece of psychedelia in Ã¢â‚¬ËœA Mind At Ease Is A Mind At PlayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nJust before you slip away into the depths of your brain, you conclude thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a lot more you could as for from such a record than to end of a nine minute frenzy of clattering cymbals and intense reverb like the hugely enjoyable ride of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSweet Hold On MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Songs Of Lies And Deceit is another intense, fierily psychedelic album from a decade which, so far, has been blessed with a generous helping of funky trips.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/the-lucid-dream-songs-of-lies-and-deceit-135743&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/the-lucid-dream-songs-of-lies-and-deceit-135743&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc3fe9a67460cd550700ce8152a6bd9d8f46d47c","amp;dn":"The+Lucid+Dream+-+Songs+of+Lies+and+Deceit+%282013%29+%5BMP3%5D%5B192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc3fe9a67460cd550700ce8152a6bd9d8f46d47c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,63,233,166,116,96,205,85,7,0,206,129,82,166,189,157,143,70,212,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
