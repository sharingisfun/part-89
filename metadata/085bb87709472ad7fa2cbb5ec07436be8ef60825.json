My apologies.\n\nThe Assassin King opens at winter's end with the arrival by sea of a mysterious hunter, a man of ancient race and purpose, who endlessly chants the names of the pantheon of demons that are his intended victims, as well as one other: Ysk, the original name of the Brother, now known as Achmed, the Assassin King of Ylorc.\n\nThis is the sixth in the Symphony of Ages series. Like the others, I've cleaned up the audio, chapterized the book, and updated all the tags. This series is, for me, a test to see how much the community likes this sort of thing. If it gets a strong positive response, I've got tons of other books I've done the same thing too I'd love to share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:085bb87709472ad7fa2cbb5ec07436be8ef60825","amp;dn":"Re-Upload%3A+The+Assassin+King+-+Elizabeth+Haydon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"085bb87709472ad7fa2cbb5ec07436be8ef60825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,91,184,119,9,71,42,215,250,44,187,94,192,116,54,190,142,246,8,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
