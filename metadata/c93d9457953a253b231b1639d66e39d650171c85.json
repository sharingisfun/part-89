Well known throughout the UK, he has created many outstandingly accurate structures on layouts such as The Gresley Beat, Burnden Park and Dewsbury Midland.\n\nAll GeoffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s methods are cost-effective, easy to follow and perfectly explained in this DVD.\n\nHe takes three very different buildings as his examples. \n\nAfter showing how he researches and plans his projects, he shows how he constructs a block of terraced houses, including doors, door frames, curtains, roof and guttering. He also explains in detail how he paints and weathers them to give them that realistic finish.\n\nNext, he moves on to a section of a London Terrace similar to the terraces in The Gresley Beat. Here he shows how he creates the complex stonework around the window frames as well as block facings and cellars.\n\nFinally, he makes a stone-fronted house and shows how he creates the corner-stones, facing stones and pebble-dash effects.\n\nAll the methods he uses can be applied to all buildings and in any scale.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how to make walls, roofs, chimneys, slates, doors and much more Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with techniques for painting, weathering and distressing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the complete package with methods suitable for all scales and gauges.\n\nSo, whatever your experience in Building Buildings, this DVD is the one for you. \n\nContents of the DVD\n\n Research and Planning\n Stone walls\n Doors and door frames\n Curtains\n Roof Slates\n Guttering and down pipes\n Chimneys\n Painting for realistic finish\n Weathering surfaces\n Stone and block facings\n Pebble-dash walls \n\nImportant: Resolution = 768 x 576.
