On our new VA, called\n'Aurora Sidera', we present something different.\nMore psychedelic, acidic and crazy as usual, but\nof course, with a blisfull melodic ending!\n\nWe open the compilation with a pure groovy TB303\nstormer by Skizologic, followed by another acidic\nfloater by Nebula Meltdown. After that we get 2\nSuntrip-newcomers (Dragon Twins and Morpic\nResonance) who present us smashing psychedelic\n'Flying Rhino'-like 90s acid-trance! E-Mantra's\nremix of Artifact303 is next with powerful\nsmashing goa-trance! The second part of the\ncompilation is more melodic. First comes Crossing\nMind in his specific twisted style, followed by 2\namazing spiraling morning trance tracks by\nMindsphere and Celestial Intelligence. The final\ntrack is a collaboration by Fench classic acts\nDenshi-Danshi and The Amtinaous, who are back for\na first release since the 90s! This track is pure\ntrance, melodic and beautiful.\n\nThis compilation is evidence Goa-trance keeps on\nevolving! Enjoy the madness.\n\nlink: www.suntriprecords.com\n\nTracks\n\n#   track                             length\n\n01  Skizologic - Retrospective         08:10\n02  Nebula Meltdown - Deep Space       06:14\n    Introspection\n03  Dragon Twins - The Third Wave      08:08\n04  Morphic Resonance - Altered        08:47\n    Perception\n05  Artifact303 - In Your Mind         08:32\n    (E-Mantra Remix)\n06  Crossing Mind - Xtatic Confusion   08:39\n07  Mindsphere - Fly High              08:01\n08  Celestial Intelligence -           10:06\n    Inevitable Feelings\n09  Denshi-Danshi &amp; The Amtinaous -    07:10\n    World In Between (2k15 Remix)\n\nNews\n\nCurrently   groov[e]mission   is  searching  for:\n- dedicated  ripper / supplier  with  fast access\nto  fresh &amp; unreleased quality  electronic  music\n(CDs, Vinyls, Promos, DigitalDownloads, Livesets)\n- collectors of old&amp;rare stuff who are interested\nto   digitize  their   collection  for   infinity\n\nWanna be part of the legend?

Nowadays  most stuff  gets spread  via\nFilehosters within a few minutes  or even seconds\nwhich is very sad to see!  We wonder why are some\ncrazy kids  doing this?   What is your intention?\n                   GET A LiFE!\n\nOf course we can understand  that people download\na CD to listen to it before buying. But please be\nhonest and buy it  if you really like it!  If you\ncall  yourself  a fan  then  you should  own  the\nreleases from your favorite artists  as original!\nIf  you  got  everything  as mp3 only you  should\nreflect  a bit more  about  the current situation\nin psytrance scene! Our beloved psytrance artists\naren't  popstars like  Madonna who earn thousands\nif not millions. Labels can be happy if they earn\nenough  money to cover all the production  costs!\nIf  this  continues that  way some artists (maybe\nyour #1 favorite!) will stop making music  and/or\nthe  production  of  CDs  will  stop  at  all and\neverything will be available  as digital download\nonly - but no download  can beat the warm &amp; fuzzy\nfeeling to hold a brand new CD from your favorite\nartist    or   label    in   your    own   hands!\n\nWe can't  repeat it  often enough,  the psytrance\nscene  is very small  and needs  your support. If\nyou LOVE this music (like we do), please BUY this\nmusic  or  VISIT some parties  (like we do)!  Our\nreleases are meant  for promotion  only - to give\nyou   a   sample   of    the   retail    product.\n\nNEVER FORGET - THiS iS NOT A COPY, iT'S JUST MP3!\n\nFurthermore we wanna say thanks to all the people\nwho made this  whole thing  happen,  in the past,\npresent and future.  And finally, we want to send\n greetings  to  all our  fellow  friends  within\n the    scene!   You   know    who    you   are!\n\nMUSiC WORTH LiSTENiNG iS MUSiC WORTH BUYiNG!!\n\ngroov[e]mission  2ooo - infinity!\n\nALL YOUR PSY ARE BELONG TO US!\n\nnfo update : o7-12-2o11\n\n* artwork by cpN of cRo in o4 *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe1ef36f7707d7040fd0acc094dd8758d000088e","amp;dn":"VA_-_Aurora_Sidera-2015-gEm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe1ef36f7707d7040fd0acc094dd8758d000088e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,30,243,111,119,7,215,4,15,208,172,192,148,221,135,88,208,0,8,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
