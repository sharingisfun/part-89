Riding on the acclaim from the likes of Interview Magazine, The Guardian and MTV the singles prove Vanbot's sense for melodies but now embark on a darker and more evocative spectrum than previously. Vanbot released her selftitled album in 2011, followed by several singles in 2012 and 2013.\n The music received rave reviews, but after that she remained silent. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The plan was to release a new album the fall of 2013, but it was canceled at the last minute. The album was almost finalized when I got cold feet, and trashed it. I had a breakdown and started all over again, from scratch.\n The reboot challenged me to up my game and I started to think outside the box. I played around with new layers of my voice, new beats, effects and synthesizers and I found something new to build on. It was the perfect storm.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This new album combines catchy melodies with warped synthezisers, euforic vocals and evocative beats in production/mixing by Johannes Berglund (The Knife, I Break Horses).\n On some tracks we also notice, by the side of Ester Ideskog, co-writers like Jan Kask (Say Lou Lou, Tove Styrke) and Adam Olenius (Shout Out Louds). The songs find tension in these contrasts, giving Vanbot a darker vein in her music","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73dfb8561a924934bebc65d75a85c3650134ed3d","amp;dn":"Vanbot+-+Perfect+Storm+%282015%29+Album+%40+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73dfb8561a924934bebc65d75a85c3650134ed3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,223,184,86,26,146,73,52,190,188,101,215,90,133,195,101,1,52,237,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
