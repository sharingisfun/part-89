Launch your satellite into orbit and go head to head with the dominant force that formed the entire universe: Gravity.\n\nThese launches wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be a spacewalk in the park, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all manner of stars, planets, comets, pulsars and more to navigate. Not to mention rival probes that will compete against you and even chase yours down. Oh, and did we mention those anti-gravity probes?\nFeatures\n\n    Experience an accurate gravity simulation with a unique minimalist aesthetic.\n    Explore 100 levels across twelve sectors, each one with its unique gameplay mechanics.\n    Experiment with teleports and bullet time to bend the very fabric of space for that perfect launch.\n    Discover and unlock 39 challenging achievements.\n    Use the intuitive editor to design your own levels and share with the world via Steam Workshop","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:779bbfd897875e8f511e84b476a7ae499c06969b","amp;dn":"0RBITALIS+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"779bbfd897875e8f511e84b476a7ae499c06969b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,155,191,216,151,135,94,143,81,30,132,180,118,167,174,73,156,6,150,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
