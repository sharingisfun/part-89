The design was a move towards modernity, with features such as a self-cleaning smokebox and electric lighting prominent in the out-shopped locomotives. \n\nThe class was designed for express passenger work and all locomotives were initially turned out in LNERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apple green livery, with repainting into British RailwaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Brunswick green livery beginning in 1949. \n\nWith the exception of the first A2 Class to enter service, all locomotive names followed LNERÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tradition of using famous racehorse names Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Blue Peter III was a racehorse owned by Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Roseberry, which in 1939 won races including the Epsom Derby and the 2000 Guineas. \n\nBlue Peter served on the mainline until 31 December 1966, two years before the end of British steam, and put into storage. However, in 1968 the locomotive was purchased by enthusiast Geoff Drury and a campaign for its restoration was launched on the famous British childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s television programme and locomotive-namesake Blue Peter. \n\nThe locomotive is now owned by the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust and awaiting restoration and renewal of its mainline boiler certificate at the famous Barrow Hill Roundhouse in Derbyshire, before returning back to mainline standard. \n\nThe Peppercorn Class A2 Blue Peter for Train Simulator recreates the famous locomotive in its current Brunswick Green livery with British Railways on the tender sides and blue-faced nameplates, as it ran between 1996 and 2001. As a preserved locomotive in the modern era, the locomotive is fitted with modern safety systems such as AWS, and also comes with BR Mk1 coaches with passenger view","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e791398f5f691d207f8842f06903c3fdacb0724c","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+LNER+Peppercorn+Class+A2+%27Blue+Peter%27+Loco+Add-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e791398f5f691d207f8842f06903c3fdacb0724c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,145,57,143,95,105,29,32,127,136,66,240,105,3,195,253,172,176,114,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
