It is no wonder that Stephen was impressed with childhood ideas of electronic music and founded several of its own projects, where he played the piano and bass guitar. But very soon he realized that none of his bandmates (and himself) can not play as good and accurate as the legendary Korg M1, and decided to replace all the &quot;real&quot; musicians &quot;virtual&quot; machines in the studio. At 17, he bought his first computer &quot;Atari&quot; and the story began ... \nAfter moving to the city of Bremen, where Stefan has continued to develop and refine his studio, he got in touch with the experimental theater scene and began to express his musical vision in composing soundtracks for several plays (including working for a reputable Bremen Goethe Theater and the famous Austrian theater &quot;Dancing Icarus&quot;). \nBut it Bodzin never lost his love for analogue and electronic music. He brings his first club tracks, which are immediately tested on the dance floors of the hands of his brother Oliver, who at the time was the House-DJ. Around the same time, Stephen met with a member of the musical group Humate Hantemannom Oliver, and this was the beginning of a strong friendship. In the next 10 years the two of them was produced by artists such as Marc Romboy, Thomas Schumacher, Elektrochemie and H-Man and made Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹a great number of remixes for artists such as Binary Finary, Frankie Goes To Hollywood or Sinead O'Connor. Furthermore, Stephan has created two successful solo projects Condor and Boca. \nIn December 2004, his friend and techno musician Thomas Schumacher asked Stephen co-produce a group Electrochemie - Project Schumacher and his girlfriend Caitlin Devlin, and a few of his songs himself. The result of this joint work, released on labels Get Phyical and Spiel-Zeug Schallplatten, like a bomb blew up the club scene, largely thanks to the talent of Stephen. \nIn 2005 Mr. Bodzin concentrating on his own career. His solo single &quot;Caligula / Marathon Man&quot;, released on the label Systematic in December 2005 was the first step on the stage, which caused a strong interest in the artist. The next step was not worse - a joint work with Mark Romboem, which resulted in their Luna EP, released on label Systematic, and tracks &quot;House Ya&quot; and &quot;Jigsaw&quot; from the debut album Romboya &quot;Gemini&quot;. \nThe list of labels, which in 2005 and 2006 Stefan's worked, the report looks like &quot;who's who&quot; in the modern electronic scene: Get Physical, Datapunk, International Deejay Gigolo, Systematic, Giant Wheel, Spiel-Zeug Schallplatten, Confused, Dance Electric and Great Stuff","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92b42b23125e516d9db020ef072e87a758d160ab","amp;dn":"Stephan+Bodzin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92b42b23125e516d9db020ef072e87a758d160ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,180,43,35,18,94,81,109,157,176,32,239,7,46,135,167,88,209,96,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
