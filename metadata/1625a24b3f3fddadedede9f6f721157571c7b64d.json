It was founded by Robert Bruce, Insane Clown Posse, and their label in 2000. The Gathering has featured bands of a variety of genres within hip hop and rock, though the majority of the acts perform horrorcore and hardcore hip hop, similar to that of Psychopathic Records artists. \nDescribed by Joseph Bruce as a &quot;Juggalo Woodstock&quot;, the Gathering of the Juggalos spans four days and includes concerts, wrestling, games, contests, autograph sessions, karaoke, and seminars with artists. Over its first eleven events, the festival has drawn an attendance of about 107,500 fans. \n\nIn July 2012, the media organization Vice released &quot;American Juggalo,&quot; a twenty-minute film documenting the festival, through their subsidiary music channel, Noisey. Sean Dunne directed the work.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1625a24b3f3fddadedede9f6f721157571c7b64d","amp;dn":"American+Juggalo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1625a24b3f3fddadedede9f6f721157571c7b64d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,37,162,75,63,63,221,173,237,237,233,246,247,33,21,117,113,199,182,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
