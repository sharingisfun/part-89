Check out for instance her ode to premature ejaculation 'Mr 5 Minutes' and you just know these are not arbitrary lyrics. \n\nThe recording has a very 'demo-ish' feel with sparse production resulting in a very clear, dynamic and full-ranged sound. I used it as a demo CD on some $30,000 speakers back in the 1990s and it rocked! The music and production are also excellent. I used to keep a few extra copies of this CD around, as almost invariably people who heard this wanted a copy for themselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b786714cd641d8a538a40f2d3bee2d73c92138","amp;dn":"Holly+McNarland-Sour+Pie+EP%2C+Canadian+alt-rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b786714cd641d8a538a40f2d3bee2d73c92138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,183,134,113,76,214,65,216,165,56,164,15,45,59,238,45,115,201,33,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
