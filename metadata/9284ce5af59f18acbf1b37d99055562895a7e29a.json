How is Fix-A-Flat like sugarless gum? Is a Slim Jim meat stick really alive? If I Can't Believe It's Not Butter isn't butter, what is it?\n\n All of these pressing questions and more are answered in This Is What You Just Put In Your Mouth? Based on his popular Wired magazine column What's Inside, Patrick Di Justo takes a cold, hard, and incredibly funny look at the shocking, disgusting, and often dumbfounding ingredients found in everyday products, from Cool Whip and Tide Pods to Spam and Play-Doh.

Along the way, he schools us on product histories, label decoding, and the highfalutin chemistry concepts behind everything from Midol to Hostess fruit pies.\n Packed with facts you're going to want to share immediately, this is infotainment at its bestÃ¢â‚¬â€and most fun!Ã¢â‚¬â€which will have you giving your shampoo the side-eye and Doritos a double take, and make you the know-it-all in line at the grocery store","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9284ce5af59f18acbf1b37d99055562895a7e29a","amp;dn":"This+Is+What+You+Just+Put+in+Your+Mouth%3F+%282015%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9284ce5af59f18acbf1b37d99055562895a7e29a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,132,206,90,245,159,24,172,191,27,55,217,144,85,86,40,149,167,226,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
