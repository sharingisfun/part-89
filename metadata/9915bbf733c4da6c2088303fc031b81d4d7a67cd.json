However, there are still serious challenges with handling time in batch plants.\n\nMost techniques tend to assume either a fixed time dimension or adopt time average models to tame the time dimension, thereby simplifying the resultant mathematical models. A direct consequence of this simplification is a suboptimal process. Synthesis, Design, and Resource Optimization in Batch Chemical Plants aims to close this scientific gap.\n\nPresenting state-of-the art models for the scheduling, synthesis, design, and resource optimization of batch chemical processes, this cutting-edge text:\n\nDescribes different ways to represent and capture time in the optimal allocation of tasks to various units with the objective of maximizing throughput or minimizing makespan\nCovers synthesis and design where the objective is mainly to yield a chemical facility, which satisfies all the targets with minimum capital cost investment\nDeals with resource conservation aspects in batch plants, where water and energy take the center stage\nSynthesis, Design, and Resource Optimization in Batch Chemical Plants offers a comprehensive discussion of scheduling techniques, continuous-time formulations, and the synthesis and design of chemical plants that optimally utilize water and energy resources","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9915bbf733c4da6c2088303fc031b81d4d7a67cd","amp;dn":"Synthesis%2C+Design%2C+and+Resource+Optimization+in+Batch+Chemical+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9915bbf733c4da6c2088303fc031b81d4d7a67cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,21,187,247,51,196,218,108,32,136,48,63,192,49,184,29,77,122,103,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
