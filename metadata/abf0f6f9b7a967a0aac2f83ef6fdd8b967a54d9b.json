Recommended for all but the smallest fiction collections.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Library Journal\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In her stunning debut novel Shilpa Agarwal takes on the ghosts that bedevil young Pinky Mittal's extended family and dispatches them with rambunctious wit and affection. The result is like finely wrought mirror work, a glittering tapestry of vibrant contradictions, characters, and mysteries. Haunting Bombay flirts deliciously with the true spirit of India.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Aimee Liu, author of Flash House*\nAfter her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death crossing the border from Pakistan to India during Partition, baby Pinky was taken in by her grandmother, Maji, the matriarch of the powerful Mittal family. Now thirteen years old, Pinky lives with her grandmother and her uncleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family in a bungalow on the Malabar Heights in Bombay. While she has never really been accepted by her uncleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family, she has always had MajiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love.\n\nOne day, as monsoons engulf the city, Pinky opens a mysteriously bolted door, unleashing the ghosts of an infant who drowned shortly before PinkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival and of the nursemaid who cared for the child. Three generations of the Mittal family must struggle to come to terms with their secrets amidst hidden shame, forbidden love, and a call for absolute sacrifice.\n\nShilpa Agarwal was born in Bombay and currently lives in Los Angeles. She is a graduate of Duke University and UCLA and has taught at both UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. As an unpublished novel, Haunting Bombay won a 2003 First Words Literary Prize for South Asian Writers. It is her first novel.\n\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nAgarwal's atmospheric if excessively detailed debut takes readers deep into the mysterious heart of Bombay in the 1960s. Thirteen-year-old Pinky Mittal lives with her obese, matriarchal grandmother, Maji; her alcoholic uncle, Jaginder; bitter aunt Savita; and three teenage male cousins. Taken in as an infant by her grandmother after her mother died, Pinky knows she's Maji's favorite, even if her aunt despises her. Driven by adolescent curiosity, Pinky unlocks a door in her family bungalow that has been bolted her entire life and unleashes the ghost of an infant girl and her midwife, sending her whole family into a tailspin. Surrounded by superstitions and spirituality, Pinky tries to unravel a past rife with pain and deceit as three generations of her formerly stalwart family crumble around her. This multigenerational family saga is rich with eccentric characters and period details, but Agarwal too often clogs the page with nonessential descriptions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abf0f6f9b7a967a0aac2f83ef6fdd8b967a54d9b","amp;dn":"Haunting+Bombay+-+Shilpa+Agarwal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abf0f6f9b7a967a0aac2f83ef6fdd8b967a54d9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,240,246,249,183,169,103,160,170,194,248,62,246,253,216,185,103,165,77,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
