In addition, the DHS Privacy Office and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) are charged with coordinating and compiling the Privacy and Civil Liberties assessments conducted by Privacy and Civil Liberties officials from other Executive Branch departments and agencies with reporting responsibilities under the Executive Order.\n\nThe first annual report, covering activities conducted by the Department during 2013, along with Privacy and Civil Liberties Assessments conducted by other departments was released as a combined document in April 2014.\n\nThis yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assessment covers Department activities conducted during fiscal year 2014. It includes a civil liberties assessment of new activities under Sections 9(a) and 9(c) of the Executive Order and also follows up on outstanding items and recommendations discussed in last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assessment of activities under Sections 4(a), 4 (b), 4(c), and 4(e) of the Executive Order. As in last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assessment, the scope of this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assessment is limited to those DHS activities that were undertaken as a result of the Executive Order or substantially altered by it. Section 5 of the Order directs the assessment of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the functions and programs undertaken by DHS as called for in this order,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the scope of the assessment is therefore limited to those functions and programs, rather than attempting to assess the many DHS cybersecurity programs and activities conducted under other authorities. Attempting to include that wide array of programs and activities within this assessment would be impractical, straining oversight office resources, and diluting the in-depth focus on the activities which are driven by the Executive Order","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0e13c13f7f0f60328203ecbddf8c27fba13802","amp;dn":"DHS+Privacy+and+Civil+Liberties+Assessment+Report","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0e13c13f7f0f60328203ecbddf8c27fba13802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,14,19,193,63,127,15,96,50,130,3,236,189,223,140,39,251,161,56,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
