CAVAFY (1863-1933) was a Greek poet who lived in Alexandria and worked as a journalist and civil servant.  During his life, he consistently refused to formally publish his work and preferred to share them through local newspapers and magazines, or even print them out himself and give then away to anyone interested.  His most important poetry was written after his fortieth birthday and officially published after his death.\n\nCavafy was instrumental in the revival and recognition of Greek poetry both at home and abroad.  His poems are, typically, concise but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and milieux that have played roles in Greek culture.  Uncertainty about the future, sensual pleasures, the moral character and psychology of individuals, homosexuality, and a fatalistic existential nostalgia are some of the defining themes.  He is known for his prosaic use of metaphors, his brilliant use of historical imagery, and his aesthetic perfectionism.  These attributes, amongst others, have assured him an enduring place in the pantheon of Western literature.\n\nOne of Cavafy's most important poems is &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot; (1904).  It poem begins by describing a city-state in decline, whose population and legislators are waiting for the arrival of the barbarians.  When night falls, the barbarians have not arrived.  The poem ends: &quot;What is to become of us without barbarians? Those people were a solution of a sort.&quot;  Another key poem is &quot;Ithaca&quot; (1911), inspired by the Homeric return journey of Odysseus to his home island, as depicted in the Odyssey.  The poem's theme is that enjoyment of the journey of life, and the increasing maturity of the soul as that journey continues, are all the traveler can ask for.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF or ePUB format as indicated:\n\n* COLLECTED POEMS: Includes Parallel Greek Text (Oxford World's Classics, 2007).
