A collection of 150 dishes (organised into chapters by country) draws together recipes for mouth-watering tacos, burgers, curries, souvlaki, gozleme, noodles and dumplings, ceviche, pizza and many more. Clever shortcuts like spice pastes and modern cooking methods (for example, using a pressure cooker to create meltingly tender meat in a snap) mean the majority of dishes can be prepared and served in a really timely and efficient way for relaxed weekday eating","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd651ca851c0b3252bfc44080dfb9a69d817fe01","amp;dn":"My+Street+Food+Kitchen+-+Jennifer+Joyce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd651ca851c0b3252bfc44080dfb9a69d817fe01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,101,28,168,81,192,179,37,43,252,68,8,13,251,154,105,216,23,254,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
