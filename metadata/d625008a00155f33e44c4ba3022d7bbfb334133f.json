Bolger\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe essence of the infantry experience is having the combination of brains, stamina, reflexes, and willpower to get out on the ground, face to face with your enemy. Today, the amazing combat power that small teams of riflemen bring to the battlefield is revolutionizing warfare. Through his examination of seven carefully selected American infantry combat operations in the 90s, author Bolger shows the reader what kind of ground combat forces America will need for tomorrow's wars.\n\n\nBook Cover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://img.bi/#/sPHo3Zm!Db5fegZf54hg5hrlCw6ZfMOAbRoaLwTonXYQpPaD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://img.bi/#/sPHo3Zm!Db5fegZf54hg5hrlCw6ZfMOAbRoaLwTonXYQpPaD&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d625008a00155f33e44c4ba3022d7bbfb334133f","amp;dn":"Death+Ground%3A+Today%27s+American+Infantry+in+Battle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d625008a00155f33e44c4ba3022d7bbfb334133f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,37,0,138,0,21,95,51,228,76,75,163,2,45,123,191,179,52,19,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
