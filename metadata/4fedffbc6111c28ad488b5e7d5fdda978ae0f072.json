Never released on CD, so this is a vinyl rip that I downloaded on the internet. You'll hear some crackling sounds. Bitrate is 224 kbps but as I say, the main issue is the background noise from the vinyl. A true punk rock classic and not available anywhere else that I know of.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fedffbc6111c28ad488b5e7d5fdda978ae0f072","amp;dn":"Rodney+on+the+ROQ+-+%5B1980%5D+MP3+%28Vinyl+rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fedffbc6111c28ad488b5e7d5fdda978ae0f072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,237,255,188,97,17,194,138,212,136,181,231,213,253,218,151,138,224,240,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
