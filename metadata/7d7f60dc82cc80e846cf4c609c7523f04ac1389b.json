This isn't really classic country perse, but it is older country. His style of singing is talking, just like he does in The Jungle Book movie. His style and voice really captivate the ears. He had a gift and it was very unique.\n\nPlease search Big Papi Country if you like good old fashioned music for your collection or to give as gifts.\n\nOh, and for you sticklers of accuracy.  The cover is not correct.  The CD in-hand has Phil posing above some beautiful blonde haired woman.  UK music production company, CD pressed in CZ.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[quote]By Leanne Martin\n\nI grew up listening to Phil Harris, as my parents were fans. I bought this CD for my old favorites, &quot;Darktown Poker Club&quot; &amp; &quot;44 Sycamore&quot;; the latter was a pleasant surprise. The only lyrics I could remember was the chorus; I had forgotten how deliciously droll the verses are. &quot;Never Trust A Woman&quot; was a new one on me. Although not PC these days, I found it amusing nonetheless. The musical accompaniment will have the stuffiest conservative's toes tapping in spite of themselves. The recording/engineering is cleaner than I thought it would be, considering when this music was first recorded. Harris' personality shines through on every song. He is the jolly uncle every kid should have, the one who always raises the grown-up's eyebrows, but delights the young ones. This CD is just plain fun. If you're young at heart &amp; enjoy big band swing music with a touch of humor in the lyrics, this CD is for you.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/zd2krJBi40.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Phil Harris - His Original &amp; Greatest Hits (JASCD 350)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Phil Harris\nAlbum................: His Original &amp; Greatest Hits (JASCD 350)\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1999\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 40 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size. If you love \nFLAC then you'll know MP3 V0 is your other buddy for going mobile when \nspace and quality are a concern\n\nThe AccurateRip data is embedded in the MP3 tags so you can look at any \ntrack to validate the accuracy of the rip.\n\n- Big Papi\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7f60dc82cc80e846cf4c609c7523f04ac1389b","amp;dn":"Phil+Harris+-+His+Original+%26amp%3B+Greatest+Hits+%28JASCD+350%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7f60dc82cc80e846cf4c609c7523f04ac1389b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,127,96,220,130,204,128,232,70,207,76,96,156,117,35,240,74,193,56,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
