It's been all we've been hearing about for the past week, so we figured we deserved a break. That's why this week's Player Attack is not an E3 special! Instead, we've put together a short history of the Australian games industry, covering nearly 40 years of development across this wide brown land.\n\nWe look at everything from Melbourne House and The Hobbit through to Krome and TY the Tasmanian Tiger and even 2K Australia and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! There's been a lot of ups and a lot of downs over the past few decades, so before you start thinking that nobody's making video games in Australia, you should probably watch this.\n\n...and, of course, come back next week for our E3 special!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd62577cf91eaa186514ffaaa512580b0427c655","amp;dn":"Player+Attack+S03E19+720p+HDTV+h264-Berg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd62577cf91eaa186514ffaaa512580b0427c655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,98,87,124,249,30,170,24,101,20,255,170,165,18,88,11,4,39,198,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
