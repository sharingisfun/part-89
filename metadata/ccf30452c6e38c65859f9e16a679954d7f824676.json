If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know where to find your data directory, please refer to the wiki: here. This method should have you synchronized in under 10 minutes. The blockchain.zip has been created from the above bootstrap.dat file.\n\n*If you are already synchronized, there is no harm in using either of these methods above, as this will give you a &quot;clean&quot; blockchain, which will further help new wallets synchronize quicker.\n\nQuick Reminder: PoS V2 Hardfork On May 6th!\n\nShadowCash will be forking on May 6th to switch to PoS v2. This is a mandatory update. Anyone who is not yet running on version 1.3.2.2 should not hesitate and update today. Please refer to our previous development update for more information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf30452c6e38c65859f9e16a679954d7f824676","amp;dn":"ShadowCoin+BlockChain+05+04+2015.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf30452c6e38c65859f9e16a679954d7f824676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,243,4,82,198,227,140,101,133,159,158,22,166,121,149,77,127,130,70,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
