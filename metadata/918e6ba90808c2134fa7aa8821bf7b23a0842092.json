Based on the characteristics and constraints of modern fiber-optic components, transport systems and fibers, the text provides relevant rules of thumb and practical hints for technology selection, WDM system and link dimensioning, and also for network-related aspects such as wavelength assignment and resilience mechanisms. Actual 10/40 Gb/s WDM systems are considered, and a preview of the upcoming 100 Gb/s systems and technologies for even higher bit rates is given as well.\n\nKey features: \n\n- Considers WDM from ULH backbone (big picture view) down to PON access (micro view). \n- Includes all major telecom and datacom applications. \n- Provides the relevant background for state-of-the-art and next-gen systems. \n- Offers practical guidelines for system / link engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:918e6ba90808c2134fa7aa8821bf7b23a0842092","amp;dn":"Wavelength+Division+Multiplexing%3A+A+Practical+Engineering+Guide+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"918e6ba90808c2134fa7aa8821bf7b23a0842092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,142,107,169,8,8,194,19,79,167,170,136,33,191,123,35,160,132,32,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
