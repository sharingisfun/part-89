No, \nthis killer prides himself on his unoriginality: he is a copycat, \nrecreating the violent murders of some of the country's most notorious \nserial killers, his heroes. On the case, is criminal psychologist Helen \nHudson who is the reigning expert on serial killers; she has also become \nagoraphobic after having too close of a brush with killer, Daryll Lee \nCullum. Though he has finally been locked up, she is unable to function \noutside her apartment. It is homicide detective M.J. Monahan and her \npartner Ruben who involve Hudson after they begin suspecting that the \nrecent rash of bizarre murders they investigate is the work of a new \nmass murderer. Using her career and her vast knowledge, she figures \nout the killer's game. She knows he is well-versed in history and that \nthe killings are tributes to the old masters. Unfortunately, she cannot \npredict his next style of killing, who he will kill, or when.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Sigourney Weaver.\n=&gt;-Holly Hunter.\n=&gt;-Dermot Mulroney.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Jon Amiel.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Crime : Horror : Mystery : Suspense.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1995.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.52 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 767 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 2h 03mn.\n=&gt;-Copycat....................: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112722/\n=&gt;-Copycat....................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1065837-copycat/\n=&gt;-Copycat....................: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/copycat-1995/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1650 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 205 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71a0eda5b0ac614e446089ebfd69d94307ace17","amp;dn":"Copycat+-+Sigourney+Weaver+Crime+1995+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f71a0eda5b0ac614e446089ebfd69d94307ace17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,26,14,218,91,10,198,20,228,70,8,158,191,214,157,148,48,122,206,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
