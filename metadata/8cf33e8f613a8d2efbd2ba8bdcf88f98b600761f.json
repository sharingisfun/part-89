The 60 technical papers from the 2nd Annual Congress on Advanced Engineering and Technology (CAET 2015, Hong Kong, 4-5 April 2015) focus on recent advanced theories and technologies for modelling, computing and data analysis in these fields, and their applications. Some of these technologies may become key factors in the success of future engineering advances, and will definitely stimulate new ideas, methods and applications.\n\nAdvanced Engineering and Technology II will be useful to academics and professionals in environmental engineering, civil engineering, water science and hydraulic engineering, food engineering, energy and chemical engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf33e8f613a8d2efbd2ba8bdcf88f98b600761f","amp;dn":"Advanced+Engineering+and+Technology+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf33e8f613a8d2efbd2ba8bdcf88f98b600761f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,243,62,143,97,58,141,46,251,210,186,139,220,248,143,152,182,0,118,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
