Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\nGuests: Dawn Cumia, Joseph Cumia\n\nEpisode 221: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sibling day (part 2) on TACS with Dawnie, Brother Joe, and Ant sitting poolside sharing childhood memories about moving, pirating cable, DawnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fear of toilets and explosions, their dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car, and the differences between parenting now and then. The Cumia clan also reminisces about their parentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends, bike clubs, boat trips, poison ivy, old school medicine, their grandma and west coast relatives, smoking, the wrath of dad, Princess Dawn, and childish adults. They share some drunken stories, talk about sex back in the day, gay Richard, dadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drinking, dad catching a crook, gun safety, teachers, go through and comment on some amazing throwback pics, laugh about Lake Ronkonkoma memories, and recall stage shows and lighting. The sibs then chat about Blotto, Nymph and the Wackers, fan feedback, Anthony almost getting killed by a fire poker, staying out of trouble, momÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s racism, Dawn gets her promo on, Ant suggests a TACS cruise, Joe suggests a bike run, and the show comes to a close with a singalong.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97230572e6f1956f40b18eb33fceae5a170a6c38","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-08-27+Sibling+Day+2+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97230572e6f1956f40b18eb33fceae5a170a6c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,35,5,114,230,241,149,111,64,177,142,179,63,206,174,90,23,10,108,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
