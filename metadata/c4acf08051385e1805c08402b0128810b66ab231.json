Fundamentals, recent advances and industrial applications are examined. The subject of particulate heat and mass transfer is currently driven by two significant applications: energy transformations 'primarily combustion' and heat transfer equipment. The first includes particle and droplet combustion processes in engineering Suspensions as diverse as the Fluidized Bed Reactors (FBR's) and Internal Combustion Engines (ICE's). On the heat transfer side, cooling with nanofluids, which include nanoparticles, has attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade both from the fundamental and the applied side and has produced several scientific publications. A monograph that combines the fundamentals of heat transfer with particulates as well as the modern applications of the subject would be welcomed by both academia and industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4acf08051385e1805c08402b0128810b66ab231","amp;dn":"Heat+and+Mass+Transfer+in+Particulate+Suspensions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4acf08051385e1805c08402b0128810b66ab231","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,172,240,128,81,56,94,24,5,192,132,2,176,18,136,16,182,106,178,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
