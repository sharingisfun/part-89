It produced 21 modern forts that could defend the strategic rail, river, and road arteries passing through narrow gaps to the flat, open plains of Flanders.\n\nThe Forts of the Meuse were the creation of General Brialmont, one of the foremost military engineers of his time. The development of new and more powerful artillery meant that Brialmont's forts were made of concrete, featuring underground barracks, storerooms, and guns protected in revolving steel turrets.\nIn August 1914, the German Army attempted a quick crossing of this area in order to reach France, but it took them 12 days to destroy the fortresses, with the 30,000 Belgian troops putting up a valiant fight.\n\nContaining maps, diagrams, and photographs taken from private collections, this book explores the design, development, and influence of the &quot;Forts of the Meuse,&quot; and highlights the importance of their role during the opening battle of World War I","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91cde52fd0e6c9d0845d80e54e4f1769fcc46288","amp;dn":"The+Forts+of+the+Meuse+in+World+War+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91cde52fd0e6c9d0845d80e54e4f1769fcc46288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,205,229,47,208,230,201,208,132,93,128,229,78,79,23,105,252,196,98,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
