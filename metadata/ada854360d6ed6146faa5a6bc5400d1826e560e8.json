R E L E A S E  N O T E S\n\nwww.7digital.de\n\nFor a long time, Francesco Tristano has\nbehaved, musically, like a wild child making\nfun of his parents supervision, and repeatedly\nran away from home to visit forbidden\nlocations. One only has to review last year s\nagenda of concerts: in between solemn dates in\nimportant venues all over the planet where he\ninterprets programs of baroque and\ncontemporary music, centring around composers\nlike Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Ravel,\nGeorge Gershwin or Dietrich Buxtehude on the\npiano, are several commitments under the\nepigraph `Francesco Tristano live . Those\nescapes have little to do with classical\nmusic; quite the opposite actually. They show\nthat Francesco s commitment to electronic\nsounds remains as alive as when he started to\nrelease his first ÃƒÂ´danceÃƒÂ¶ records on InfinÃŽËœ,\neven though over the last years he\nconsolidated his position as one of the most\nrequested pianists with one of the most\nbrilliant repertoires of his generation.\n\nWhen Francesco Tristano escapes to a club, the\nspirit which possesses him is the one of\nTechno, specifically the original Detroit\nsound. There, in the heat of the cabin, he\nswitches from piano to synthesizer, from\npedals to software and what flows out of the\nspeakers is a kind of music, which can only\nfit in this hedonistic context and the\ncelebration of the body: expansive, rhythmic,\nemotional, sprinkled with piano stabs and\nunstoppable grooves. The material he uses is\ntypically self-composed and unreleased,\nsecretly produced in seclusion, to nurture a\nmusical discourse, which only makes sense if\nit s carried out like some kind of jam\nsession, with the continuity of a DJ set,\nwithout exactly being a classic DJ set. There\nare transitions, but there are no mixes; and\nif there are tracks by other artists, they\nappear as elements facilitating the creation\nof a live remix. And from this accumulated\nexperience, the idea and the content of volume\n16 of the Body Language series was born.\n\nPart of the Techno material Francesco Tristano\nwas working on over the last few months has\nalready appeared last December on the ÃƒÂ´Piano,\nHats &amp; StabsÃƒÂ¶ E.P., his first record for Get\nPhysical. Some of those tracks are re-\nappearing now on ÃƒÂ´Body LanguageÃƒÂ¶ in the form\nthey were originally intended to be: as\npieces, designed to fit into a much more\nambitious and complex construction. With the\nexception of ÃƒÂ´The HarvestÃƒÂ¶ ÃƒÂ» a Jazz classic,\nidentifiable as Proto-Techno, that opened Joe\nZawinul s album Dialects (1986), which\nimportance could be compared to Herbie\nHancock s ÃƒÂ´RockitÃƒÂ¶, Francesco Tristano s\nentire journey expresses itself in form of\noriginal productions (ÃƒÂ´OngakuÃƒÂ¶, ÃƒÂ´JinguruÃƒÂ¶),\nwritten in collaboration with other musicians.\nHere we are listening for the first time to\nÃƒÂ´AmnesieÃƒÂ¶, half-half with Luciano, or the new\nproject KhalifeSchumacherTristano, which was\nborn from the ashes of ÃƒÂ´AufgangÃƒÂ¶ and remixed\nby Reboot ÃƒÂ» or material that was given to him\nby partners of the label, friends and other\nartists from his surroundings, like P41, aka\nthe sound engineer Edoardo Pietrogrande; or\nDanton Eeprom, ex-partner in the InfinÃŽËœ days;\nCardopusher, neighbour in Barcelona; and also\nM.A.N.D.Y., representatives of his new home-\nlabel, Get Physical.\n\nOn a traditional DJ album, the added value\nlies apart from the musical selection in the\nbravery of the mix. In the case of Body\nLanguage, the importance is not so much in the\nbeat-matching, but much rather in the key-\nmixing. To round off the transitions of the\ntracks, Francesco Tristano has deployed all\nhis musical wisdom, to add layers of\nsynthesizers and piano attacks all over the\nplace, to complete the rhythmic journey with a\ndense harmonic richness. His own tracks are\nborn from piano grooves ÃƒÂ» you might even\nnotice some chords borrowed from the &quot;Suite In\nA Minor&quot; by Jean-Philippe Rameau, one of the\nmost important composers of the French baroque\nÃƒÂ» and are always expanding in the depth of\nouter space. The result may sound familiar on\nfirst listening, but it becomes deeper when\npaying attention to the details and chord\nprogressions. The architecture of the\ncomposition is actually quite surprising: Deep\nHouse and Detroit 2.0 with a sonic density,\nwhich is unknown in contemporary club music.\nThe expression that best describes the musical\nphilosophy of Francesco Tristano might be\nÃƒÂ´Bach to the FutureÃƒÂ¶. On Body Language there\nis no Bach, but the future is constructing\nitself minute by minute.\n\nURL: n/a\n\n.   .
