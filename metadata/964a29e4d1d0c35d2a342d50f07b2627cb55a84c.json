The opening two chapters provide an introduction to GaudÃƒÂ­'s biography and the social and cultural context of Barcelona amidst which he developed his remarkable and original architecture. Following this his work is examined in four detailed chapters. The first two chapters provide a survey of GaudÃƒÂ­'s development as an architect by tracing the contribution he made to two areas of architecture; firstly his secular, domestic architecture, including the remarkable Casa MilÃƒÂ¡; and secondly his designs and completed buildings for the Church, such as the Episcopal palace in Astorga. The final two chapters also provide a survey of that spans much of GaudÃƒÂ­'s life, but concentrated on the one hand on the buildings constructed for his patron Eusebio GÃƒÂ¼ell and on the other the monumental and world renowned church of the Sagrada Familia. Critical analysis is offered of each of his buildings with the aim to identify the development of his original architectural style","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:964a29e4d1d0c35d2a342d50f07b2627cb55a84c","amp;dn":"Antoni+Gaudi+%28Architecture+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"964a29e4d1d0c35d2a342d50f07b2627cb55a84c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,74,41,228,209,208,195,93,42,52,45,80,240,123,38,39,203,85,168,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
