There no need to tinker with confusing settings with years of experience built-in, it just works out of the box. All you have to do is download and run AntiMalware then sit back for about few minutes while it scans your machine and eliminates all potential threats. AntiMalware is highly optimized and lightweight with virus definitions stored in the cloud, not cluttering up your drive.\n\nDramatically improve your security\nAntiMalware bypasses malware infections to perform a thorough scan, and cleans even the most advanced threats like rootkit and bootkits. AntiMalware uses the Scan Cloud, a highly optimized cluster of computers running 10 always-up-to-date Antivirus Engines. This gives you the power of multi-scanning without any of the downsides such as drain on system resources and conflicts between programs.\n\nHow it works\nOnce you have downloaded Zemana AntiMalware, you can start a scan. Zemana AntiMalware does not store virus definitions on your PC. Instead, when our software finds a suspicious file, it passes the fingerprint to the Scan Cloud where 10 different anti-virus engines perform checks. Milliseconds later, the Scan Cloud marks the file as safe or malicious, or else asks AntiMalware to upload it for further examination. Zemana AntiMalware rapidly sets about removing any confirmed malicious software.\n\nWhy cloud-based multi-engine scanning?\nCurrently, at least 300K malware threats are detected daily. Not all engines can detect all threats, so one antivirus engine is no longer enough. Only multi-engine scanning technology can ensure no threat goes undetected. That why we use 10 different antivirus engines. The best place for these engines is on the cloud, rather than interfering with each other and using up your system resources hence our Scan Cloud.\n\nCloud-based multi-engine scanning provides many benefits including:\n- Reduced detection time for new virus outbreaks.\n- Increased zero hour detection rates for all types of malware.\n- Rapid simultaneous scanning by multiple engines without conflicts or system resource issues.\n\nScan Cloud\nScan Cloud is highly optimized cluster of Virtual Machines running on Microsoft Azure platform and uses 5 best AV engines from Metascan 16 plus our in-house developed engine.\n\nZemana Anti-Malware Benefits:\n- Removes unwanted apps, annoying toolbars or browser add ons.\n- Finds and removes even deeply embedded advanced threats like rootkits and bootkits.\n- Multi-AV engine scanning.\n- Scans thousands of files per second.\n- Compatible with other antivirus solutions.\n- In-house algorithms for zero false positives.\n- Does not slow down your PC.\n- Easy-to-use.\n\nWhat's New\n- This is the stable release of the previous BETA version (2.15.1.206)\nKnown Issues\n- Support for Safe Boot Mode\n\nPLEASE READ THIS : TPB FOUNDER arrested in ASIA : \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Pirate-Bay-Founder-Fredrik-Neij-Arrested-in-Asia?pid=103934#pid103934&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Pirate-Bay-Founder-Fredrik-Neij-Arrested-in-Asia?pid=103934#pid103934&lt;/a&gt;\n\nplease leave a supporting message on the forum . what's happening to Frederik and his FAMILLY ain't fair ... I would even say that THIS IS A SHAME . \n\nAS [WTC-SWE] would so nicely say :\n\nWTC-SWE Wrote:\nThey can all suck D..k ... MIAA/RIAA.. etc...
