The actors did a good job although I think Hazel's part could have been improved. The background music was perfect and the songs were also nice and really blended well with the situations. The plot was weak at some places but for most of the part it was fine. The direction requires some more effort, at times it really felt director had no control of his movie and editing could have done away with some scenes especially the Horny Sheikh ones...those cheap jokes were not really worth the effort. All said and done it is one fine romantic treat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68145b37ab6003ff010b1fed05c443e1fb89f562","amp;dn":"MP3+-+Mera+Pehla+Pehla+Pyar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68145b37ab6003ff010b1fed05c443e1fb89f562","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,20,91,55,171,96,3,255,1,11,31,237,5,196,67,225,251,137,245,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
