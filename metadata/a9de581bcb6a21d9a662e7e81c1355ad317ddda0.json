Readers gain a thorough understanding of the theory underlying themethods presented in the text. The author emphasizes the practical steps involved in implementing the methods, culminating in readers learning how to write programs using FORTRAN90 and MATLAB(r) to solve ordinary and partial differential equations. \nThe book begins with a review of direct methods for the solution of linear systems, with an emphasis on the special features of the linear systems that arise when differential equations are solved. The following four chapters introduce and analyze the more commonly used finite difference methods for solving a variety of problems, including ordinary and partial differential equations and initial value and boundary value problems. The techniques presented in these chapters, with the aid of carefully developed exercises and numerical examples, can be easilymastered by readers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9de581bcb6a21d9a662e7e81c1355ad317ddda0","amp;dn":"The+Numerical+Solution+of+Ordinary+and+Partial+Differential+Eq","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9de581bcb6a21d9a662e7e81c1355ad317ddda0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,222,88,27,203,106,33,217,166,98,231,232,28,19,85,173,49,125,221,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
