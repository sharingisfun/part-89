They're a duo made up of singer/lyricist Jason Williamson and musician/producer Andrew Fearn, and about the most distinctly English group playing Glastonbury in 2015.\n \nThey make raw, politicised music for times of austerity. In Williamson, the group have a great poet of the everyman - a cross between John Cooper Clarke, The Streets and the nutty bloke down the pub who perfectly articulates day-to-day experiences but spits in your face when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talking. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not pretty, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not pretty, but we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live in pretty times and Sleaford Mods are deserving of the bigger audience this debut Glastonbury performance provides.\n\n\nVideo 852 x 480 / 25 fps / 1405 kbps / MP4\n\nAudio 192 kbps Lame MP3\n\nDuration 0:37\n\nSeed, Seed, Seed . . .
