One goes to Paris, one to the Corsican Mountains to become, respectively, a gentleman and a bandit. What will happen? &quot;I have performed the miracle I have separated their bodies. But what of their souls?&quot; Lucien [the bandit] feels everything Mario [the Parisian fop - I mean, gentleman] feels. 20 years pass...then another year...and they are reunited in Corsica. Banditry and vendetta and a beautiful Corsican countess ensue.\n- Written by Chris in Oxford UK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc180443e5b0a01cf01512ad6f11836c49e1637f","amp;dn":"The+Corsican+Brothers+%281941%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc180443e5b0a01cf01512ad6f11836c49e1637f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,24,4,67,229,176,160,28,240,21,18,173,111,17,131,108,73,225,99,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
