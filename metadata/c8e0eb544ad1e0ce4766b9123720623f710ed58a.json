And like most gamers, he almost spends more time on the VirtNet than in the actual world. The VirtNet offers total mind and body immersion, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s addictive. Thanks to technology, anyone with enough money can experience fantasy worlds, risk their life without the chance of death, or just hang around with Virt-friends. And the more hacking skills you have, the more fun. Why bother following the rules when most of them are dumb, anyway?\n\nBut some rules were made for a reason. Some technology is too dangerous to fool with. And recent reports claim that one gamer is going beyond what any gamer has done before: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s holding players hostage inside the VirtNet. The effects are horrificÃ¢â‚¬â€the hostages have all been declared brain-dead. Yet the gamerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motives are a mystery.\n\nThe government knows that to catch a hacker, you need a hacker.\nAnd theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been watching Michael. They want him on their team.\nBut the risk is enormous. If he accepts their challenge, Michael will need to go off the VirtNet grid. There are back alleys and corners in the system human eyes have never seen and predators he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even fathomÃ¢â‚¬â€and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the possibility that the line between game and reality will be blurred forever.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8e0eb544ad1e0ce4766b9123720623f710ed58a","amp;dn":"James+Dashner+-+The+Eye+of+Minds+%28The+Mortality+Doctrine+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8e0eb544ad1e0ce4766b9123720623f710ed58a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,224,235,84,74,209,224,206,71,102,185,18,55,32,98,63,113,14,213,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
