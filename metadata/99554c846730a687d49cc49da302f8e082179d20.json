She uncovers a side of the fight for suffrage many of us have not heard: the intimate tie between the anti-slavery campaign and the struggle for women's suffrage. She shows how the racist and classist bias of some in the women's movement have divided its own membership. Davis' message is clear: If we ever want equality, we're gonna have to fight for it together","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99554c846730a687d49cc49da302f8e082179d20","amp;dn":"Angela+Y.+Davis+-+Women%2C+Race+%26amp%3B+Class+%281983%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99554c846730a687d49cc49da302f8e082179d20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,85,76,132,103,48,166,135,212,156,196,157,163,2,248,224,130,23,157,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
