Inspired by a series of public lectures given at the Dallas Museum of Art between 2009 and 2013, the volume comprises twelve beautifully illustrated essays from leading academics and museum specialists. Opening with a new reading of one of Gustave CourbetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great hunting scenes, The Fox in the Snow, and ending with an exploration of a group of interior scenes by Edouard Vuillard, each essay stands alone as a richly contextualized reading of a single work or group of works by one artist. The authors approach their subjects from a range of methodological perspectives, but all pay close attention to the experience of making and viewing works of art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc0fa6a39c565fd25c3bd8bbb93c5282c460fc1f","amp;dn":"Impressionism+and+Post-Impressionism+at+the+Dallas+Museum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc0fa6a39c565fd25c3bd8bbb93c5282c460fc1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,15,166,163,156,86,95,210,92,59,216,187,185,60,82,130,196,96,252,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
