The player takes part in the competition, which aim is not crossing finish line as fast as possible, but to cause as much damage and loss in people as possible.\nCarmageddon: Reincarnation is another game in the series of extremely controversial racing games in which blood pours heavily, and the player, while driving, can brutally run over the strolling pedestrians. The first game got famous mainly because of its subject matter, and the latest installment is a real return to the roots, what ensures the experienced Stainless Games studio.\nThe gameplay has not changed significantly in comparison to the predecessors. Our main task is still to cause the greatest destruction and loss of life on the street Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the classic idea of racing is secondary in this case. The winner is the one who unscrupulously used all available means to raise a true bloody hell. The developers tried to preserve the well-known black humor, which greatly contributed to the success of the original Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it manifests itself both in the types of available power-ups, as well as in numerous hidden special places. Available maps are also characterized by above-average size, several times bigger than those that we know from the previous games. All levels are divided into three categories: city, snowy place, or extra-urban area.\nThe players are offered over 20 cars, the vast majority of which are those well-known from the previous games. Additionally, they are controlled by well-known and popular characters such as Max Damage, Die Anna, Stella Stun, or Vlad. Each of the cars we can drive in career mode, free ride, or multiplayer. The creators also enabled support for the modding community, and the ability to play using split screen.\nGraphic design has been greatly improved compared to the previous installments. It is not surprising, however, since the release of the last of them happened nearly 15 years. The whole was designed to meet the latest standards, including HD resolution, advanced damage system, and realistic physics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3481cfe00cd196d8392b534917c7cb624e101a5","amp;dn":"Carmageddon.Reincarnation.PC.2015.Repack-R.G.Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3481cfe00cd196d8392b534917c7cb624e101a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,72,28,254,0,205,25,109,131,146,181,52,145,124,124,182,36,225,1,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
