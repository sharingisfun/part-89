Written by the renowned editors B. Cornils and W. A. Herrmann, this book presents every important aspect of aqueous-phase organometallic catalysis, a method which saves time, waste and money. The large-scale application of this &quot;green&quot; technology in chemical industry clearly underlines its practical use outside of academia.\nNew chapters (for example &quot;Organic Chemistry in Water&quot;), 20% more content and fully updated contributions from a plethora of international authors make this book a &quot;must-have&quot; for everyone working in this field. \nFrom the reviews of the first edition: \n&quot;This overview will be extremely useful for everyone active in this field [...]&quot; Angewandte Chemie \n&quot;This book is an essential in any chemical research library and I strongly recommend it to all synthetic research and teaching chemists. [...]&quot; The Alchemist \n&quot;The editors are to be congratulated on assembling such a wide range of contributors who have described the industrial as well as the academic aspects of the subject.&quot; [...] Journal of Organometallic Chemistry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd5b8e6c95f33610dc0f84d7aca5fcc7cc3c50e1","amp;dn":"Aqueous-Phase+Organometallic+Catalysis+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd5b8e6c95f33610dc0f84d7aca5fcc7cc3c50e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,91,142,108,149,243,54,16,220,15,132,215,172,165,252,199,204,60,80,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
