She is the spitting image of his college girlfriend, Marissa Minor, who died in a campus house fire twenty years earlier. But when Nick tries to speak to her, she acts skittish and rushes off.\n\nThe next morning the police arrive at NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house and show him a photo of the woman from the store. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been found dead, murdered in a local motel, with NickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name and address on a piece of paper in her pocket.\n\nConvinced there's a connection between the two women, Nick enlists the help of his college friend Laurel Davidson to investigate the events leading up to the night of MarissaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. But the young womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder is only the beginning...and the truths Nick uncovers may make him wish he never doubted the lies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b46a32e6b37f3574bdcb210f15c1e4165790a060","amp;dn":"Somebody+I+Used+To+Know+-+David+Bell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b46a32e6b37f3574bdcb210f15c1e4165790a060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,106,50,230,179,127,53,116,189,203,33,15,21,193,228,22,87,144,160,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
