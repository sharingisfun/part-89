But the number of people who make it at home is much smaller. The reason? Making this sweet treat yourself is kind of a pain. Ice cream machines can be expensive, bulky and hard to store, or cheap and inefficient. But what if you could make your own ice cream at home without all of the fuss, for a fraction of the cost of buying it, and without any special equipment? No-Churn Ice Cream is a mouthwatering collection of shortcuts and classic culinary techniques that help you achieve delicious, artisanal results.\n\nAll you need to make your quick and easy no-churn ice cream are the following simple tools:\n\n* A freezer\n* A whisk or electric mixer\n* A can opener\n* A bowl and a freezable container, such as a loaf pan\n* A sweet tooth!\n\nInside you'll find recipes for all the basic flavors, plus more complex and exciting flavors such as Pineapple-Peppercorn and Sweet Potato Marshmallow Swirl. Treat yourself with a decadent Stracciatella gelato or Bananas Foster sorbet, or cool off with some Lavender-Almond sherbet. Your flavor variations are limited only by your imagination. Why not add some bacon to that batch of chocolate-caramel ice cream? Leslie Bilderback, author of Mug Cakes, is here to show you how","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed177dc67b6ad28e577d3a5482928de65238160f","amp;dn":"No-Churn+Ice+Cream+-+Leslie+Bilderback","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed177dc67b6ad28e577d3a5482928de65238160f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,23,125,198,123,106,210,142,87,125,58,84,130,146,141,230,82,56,22,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
