From fundamentals and basic theory to design optimization, evaluation, measurements and simulation techniques, all the essential information is included. You will also get many practical examples from a range of wireless systems, whilst a glossary is provided to bring you up to speed on the latest terminology. A wide variety of small antennas is covered, and design and practice steps are described for each type: electrically small, functionally small, physically constrained small and physically small. Whether you are a professional in industry, a researcher, or a graduate student, this is your essential guide to small antennas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc2a607cca034b105c26688197254ee5100ec23e","amp;dn":"Modern+Small+Antennas+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc2a607cca034b105c26688197254ee5100ec23e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,42,96,124,202,3,75,16,92,38,104,129,151,37,78,229,16,14,194,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
