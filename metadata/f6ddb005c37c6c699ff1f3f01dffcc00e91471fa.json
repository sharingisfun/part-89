And I didn't even have to cheat: 7-week limited\n            run, which means there were 6 weeks between the first and last issue;\n            issue 1 was posted a week late, so there were only 5 weeks between first\n            and last release; and all of those 5 Weeklies fell into the June window.\n            Nice, huh? :D If I count each of those 7 issues separately, obviously\n            that publisher (Dark Horse) comes out on top this time - but even\n            without that, Image uncharacteristically takes a back seat with only one\n            title, behind Boom with two and on par with one independently-published\n            book. Anyway, what matters is that it's all good stuff, right? ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ddb005c37c6c699ff1f3f01dffcc00e91471fa","amp;dn":"gesserit%27s+favourites%3A+First+Issues+for+June+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ddb005c37c6c699ff1f3f01dffcc00e91471fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,221,176,5,195,124,108,105,159,241,243,240,29,255,204,0,233,20,113,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
