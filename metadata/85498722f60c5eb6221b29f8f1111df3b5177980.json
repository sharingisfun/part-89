They were invited to\ncollaborate in studios over the course\nof more than six months. A selection of\nthe outcome of these cross-continental\nexperiments can be heard on this\nrecord.\n\nIt's no surprise that the results are\nfar from what many would term 'World\nMusic' and its often generic mixture of\naural cliches, where all too often\nAfrican music (as with that of the rest\nof the planet) from Mali to Madagascar,\nand from Morocco to Malawi is all filed\nunder one ridiculous, meaningless\ngenre.s\n\nTEN CITIES attempts to do something\nquite different: whilst searching for\ncommon ground it is also trying to\nhighlight the differences. As a result\nhip-hop from the squats of Naples, bass\nmusic from Bristol, experimental techno\nfrom Berlin or jazz-tinged deep-house\nfrom Kiev are thrust upon the pumping\nkuduro of Luanda, the free-thinking\ncrackled electronica of Cairo, afro-\njazz from Lagos or the Sheng street-\nslang of Kenyan rap.\n\npsst, more info at soundwayrecords.com\n\n01     Octa Push - Khuchende Halala                         04:57\n02     Pinch - Are You Coming With Us                       05:41\n03     Dirty Paraffin - Choborops                           04:27\n04     Lunabe &amp; Djeff - Temedo                              05:41\n05     Batida - Mama Watoto                                 03:10\n06     Just A Band &amp; Octa Push - Boom Boom Boom             03:50\n07     Lunabe - Quero Falar                                 03:00\n08     Rob Smith - Work                                     04:28\n09     Wura Samba And Gebruder Teichmann - Antere           04:44\n10     Diamond Version &amp; Bikya &amp; Wetrobots - Dv_Bk_Wr_06    03:30\n11     Vakula &amp; Planet Lindela - Ten Cities Masala          04:52\n12     Perera Elsewhere - Ebora (Spirits)                   02:30\n13     Dubmasta &amp; Hannes Teichmann &amp; Leon Erasmus - 10      05:59\n       Henry Nxumalo Street\n14     Diamond Version &amp; Bikya &amp; Wetroots - Dv_Bk_Wr_01     06:19\n15     Afrologic - Omode Mewa (Ten Little Children)         04:36\n16     Vakula &amp; Planet Lindela - Jozi Sunset                07:35\n17     Oren Gerlitz - Orange Green                          02:47","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85498722f60c5eb6221b29f8f1111df3b5177980","amp;dn":"VA-Ten_Cities-%28SNDWCD069%29-CD-2014-jAZzMan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85498722f60c5eb6221b29f8f1111df3b5177980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,73,135,34,246,12,94,182,34,27,41,248,241,17,29,243,181,23,121,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
