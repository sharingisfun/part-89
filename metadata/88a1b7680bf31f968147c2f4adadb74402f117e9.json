Tom Hulce, Ray Liotta, Jamie Lee Curtis\n\n1 Award Win and 2 Nominations - Golden Globes, CSA, Venice Film Festival\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095050/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095050/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTwelve seconds and a world of difference separate Dominick and Eugene, fraternal twins whose mental abilities vary tremendously. Gino is a hard-working medical student, and his education is being paid for by Nicky, who is proud of being able to provide for his slightly younger brother. However, Nicky's own career is less distinguished, since he works cheerfully and at the height of his abilities as a garbage man. An accident that occurred when the twins were young has kept Nicky in a perpetually childlike state.\n\nAs directed by Robert M. Young, Dominick and Eugene has a refreshing plainness and a welcome unwillingness to milk the story for more pathos than is warranted. It examines the brothers' growing realization that, at 26, they must become more independent of one another. But it accomplishes this by means of genuinely involving plot developments, along with a rather startling denouement.\n\n\nDUAL AUDIO:\nSpanish - MP3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\nEnglish - AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x404, 29.970 fps, 1050 Kbps, 01h49m17s, no subtitles\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/mr48hlxhr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/mr48hlxhr/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/7sh89ft1r/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/7sh89ft1r/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/402b7g2xb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/402b7g2xb/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5zebl47v3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/5zebl47v3/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ekc8q17f3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/ekc8q17f3/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88a1b7680bf31f968147c2f4adadb74402f117e9","amp;dn":"Dominick+and+Eugene+%5BRay+Liotta%2C+Jamie+Lee+Curtis%5D+DUAL.Eng.Spa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88a1b7680bf31f968147c2f4adadb74402f117e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,161,183,104,11,243,31,150,129,71,194,244,173,173,183,68,2,241,23,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
