This book is the first full length study of the a &quot;neighbours of the EUaÃ¢â€žÂ¢'s neighboursaÃ¢â€žÂ¢, a concept originally introduced by the European Commission with reference to Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. These regions in the EUaÃ¢â€žÂ¢'s broader neighbourhood are often perceived as an a &quot;arc of crisisaÃ¢â€žÂ¢ from which manifold challenges emanate for Europe. This timely book takes stock of the state of the EUaÃ¢â€žÂ¢'s cooperation with the neighbours of its neighbours and explores how the concept might help promote security, stability and prosperity beyond the countries which are formally part of the European Neighbourhood Policy.\n\nNumber of pages: 315\n\nISBN13: 9781472417770\n\nISBN10: 1472417771\n\nFormat: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:808f412d9514543f25aad4ff57117fc7c83a89a1","amp;dn":"The+Neighbours+of+the+European+Union%27s+Neighbours+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"808f412d9514543f25aad4ff57117fc7c83a89a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,143,65,45,149,20,84,63,37,170,212,255,87,17,127,199,200,58,137,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
