I have inserted that extra section into this torrent along with the result of merging the two together (and making the running time 1h 45mn instead of 1h 44mn).\n\nAlthough the head section does not include any additional credits, it does include a reading by Mr. Cohen from the Tibetan Book Of The Dead with a child sitting beside him. As well, the date and location where the first scene takes place is indicated.\n------------------------------\n\nPreemptive: If you're wondering what all those little dots and fuzzy lines are that appear in many scenes; those arise due to a certain kind of *jpeg artifact removal* technique. Just like photoshop.\n------------------------------\n\nWhat this avi in fact is, is a near-duplicate/de-interlaced version of the reconstruction/re-release of Tony Palmer's extraordinary (ha!) documentary about Leonard Cohen's 1972 European tour, one or the other of which (tour or documentary) is or was, and this sentence is already WAY TOO LONG so I won't look it up, entitled &quot;Bird On A Wire&quot;.\n\n[What a pitiful adjective Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ &quot;extraordinary&quot;. Could use someone like that Cohen fellow to write a proper review.]\n\nUnfortunately the &quot;exact&quot; match is so blatantly interlaced I had to interrupt the process and start all over again so as to include a de-interlace operation which had to run simultaneously with the sizing operation in order that the desired number of encodings (ie. 1) be maintained.\n\nNow, unfortunately, in order for you to fully appreciate both the conundrum detailed below as well as the importance of preserving, as much as possible, this film's original content, you actually need to view quite a bit of it. Also, I ran out of words about 2 paragraphs ago.\n\nBut anyway, for me, about half way through maybe, I realized that Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ er.. that somehow, through performing a familiar series of mindless, mechanical operations there I was, suddenly in possession a kind of &quot;thing&quot; (the video) very obviously of *tremendous* value. Of an incalculable value! A value well in excess of any dollar amount I can think of. And there this thing sits, my so-called &quot;perfect offering&quot; marred horrendously with what started to look like dark crayon lines. And of course growing darker and larger with the &quot;thing&quot;s ever-growing incalculable value.\n\nI have to mention how I (and you could too) found the DVD source for this RIP. The way to find it is to keep trying all the various duds out there until one of them eventually works (maybe). I forget which one it was. They all have the same name but different hashes. So you'd have to remember the hash. Anyway, the one I found will certainly die out soon enough.\n\nWhy? Because nobody (and for good reason) wants any .BUP's or .IFO's or .VOB's or .CUE's or .ETC's and all the hassle that implies. Like, for instance the near-certain failure to produce a working plastic?!?! disk because you're in the wrong country or something. And nobody has the patience or the months required to figure out how to properly form an XviD/Avi from a collection of &quot;.FUK's&quot; Right?  Right?\n\nI would feel the same way too, except I happen to be one of those idiots who's already wasted all that time.\n\nSo by logical deduction it must die and I must replace it.\n\nAs for the rest? Hey, I'm not LC!\n\nBUT I SHOULD ADD THIS WARNING:\n------------------------------\nSome of this film's VISUAL content IS HIGHLY DISTURBING. Be forewarned that nothing has been edited out to protect you from seeing things that, in all honesty, nobody should ever have to see. So please be very careful if you are sensitive certain types of (especially &quot;war&quot;) imagery. Maybe have someone else look ahead for you. Personally, I had to look away at one point.\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Details\n-------------\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Bird On A Wire (Film 1972).XviD.AC3.HDTV.720p.avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                           : OpenDML\nFile size                                : 4.60 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 45mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 6 255 Kbps\nWriting application                      : MEncoder r33883\nWriting library                          : VirtualDub build 35491/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : No\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 45mn\nBit rate                                 : 5 988 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.217\nStream size                              : 4.41 GiB (96%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 63\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 1h 45mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 193 MiB (4%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 500 ms\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nInstructions for merging head.avi with the video @ torrent #10639931\n====================================================================\n\nWindows Systems:\n----------------\n1. Download and install the XviD &quot;Video For Windows&quot; encoder/decoder from any suitable website. The installer I used was called &quot;Xvid-1.3.2-20110601.exe&quot; which is not the latest version, but a search for that file name will bring you to one of the download sites that hosts the XviD codec and related tools.\n\n2. Download VirtualDub from sourceforge. You can, and probably should just download the .zip file containing the program and, AFTER unblocking the zip file, unzip its contents into a folder somewhere on your hard drive. Then run the program and select &quot;Direct Stream Copy&quot; for both audio and video.\n\n3. Select File/Open and navigate to &quot;head.avi&quot; included here.\n\n4. Select &quot;File&quot; / &quot;Append Avi Segment&quot; then navigate to your current version of the film called:\n\n&quot;Bird On A Wire (Film 1972).XviD.AC3.HDTV.720p.avi&quot;\n\nand select &quot;Open&quot;. \n\n5. Press F7 (save) and then choose a destination file name that is NOT &quot;Bird On A Wire (Film 1972).XviD.AC3.HDTV.720p.avi&quot; and NOT &quot;head.avi&quot; because you can't overwrite your source files during a save operation.\n\nIt should take about 5 minutes to generate the complete file that will be byte-for-byte identical with the merged file from *this* torrent. No encoding needs to be done, only a so-called &quot;multiplex&quot; which is just like &quot;copy&quot;.\n\nNon-Windows Systems:\n--------------------\n\nThe Virtual Dub instructions are the same. As far as obtaining the XviD &quot;Video For Windows&quot; decoder/encoder well, that I do not know about. Sorry!\n\n*************\n\nAlternately, under Windows or Linux you can use any multiplexing software available. Another choice is &quot;Avidemux&quot; for both Windows and Linux which can be used to perform the same actions described above using their interface. In fact, that may be easier than using Virtual Dub!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b95ad09ffca6bde5887734112116fe4f5250b71","amp;dn":"Leonard.Cohen.Bird.On.A.Wire.1972.Film.Tony.Palmer.XviD.AC3.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b95ad09ffca6bde5887734112116fe4f5250b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,149,173,9,255,202,107,222,88,135,115,65,18,17,111,228,245,37,11,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
