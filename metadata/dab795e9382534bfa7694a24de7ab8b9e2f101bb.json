Mace broke up with her, though, and the loss of him rocked her world. But Stella gets a call, late at night (again) from one of the members of her crazy band. She has to go play clean up (again) and runs into Mace and a shed load of police, and ends up getting shot.\n\nMace finds he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like it much that his ex-girlfriend got shot right in front of him but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse. A very bad man has thrown down the gauntlet and all the Rock Chicks are in the firing line. Stella doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want Mace to be the one to keep her alive, but she has no choice. Mainly because Mace isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t giving her one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab795e9382534bfa7694a24de7ab8b9e2f101bb","amp;dn":"Kristen+Ashley+-+Rock+Chick+Reckoning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab795e9382534bfa7694a24de7ab8b9e2f101bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,183,149,233,56,37,52,191,167,105,74,36,222,122,184,185,226,241,1,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
