The AUthor has undoubtedly thrown much light upon this debatable topic, and the new evidence he has produced reaches beyond the circumstantial. This new evidence should be well examined and considered, not judged hastily, but without prejudice and, what is equally important, without yielding to emotion through prejudiced ideas. The weakness of the orthodox position, particularly with regard to the Ascension, is manifested by the manner in which Christian apologists shrink from the discussion of so important a question.\n\nAccording to the oral and written evidence of distinguished people in Srinagar, the occupant of the above tomb is a Prophet, Yus Asaf by name and also called Prince, who came to Kashmir some 1900 years ago.The author of the Tarikh-i-Azami of Kashmir, a historical work written some 200 years ago refers to this tomb as follows; \nThe tomb next to that of Sayyed Nasr-ud-Din is generally known as that of a prophet who was sent to the inhabitants of Kashmir, and the place is known as the shrine of a prophet. He was a Prince who came to righteousness and devotion, he was made a prophet by God and was engaged in preaching to the Kashmiris. His name was Yus Asaf. (p. 82) Yus Asaf in Hebrew means Jesus, the Gatherer. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollowing is the location where Jesus is buried.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Rozabal/@34.094209,74.816296,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x44fae1e270113ec6&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam.
