This book, a translation of the original German text, is intended to provide assistance in solving the questions that arise in designing a vessel. The book focuses on tube heat exchangers, which contribute significantly to economic efficiency in the power station circuit. It covers sophisticated heat exchangers subjected to high operating loads from whose design and construction valuable information has been obtained","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2ae6e4d8dda91fd2a8712bd6a493de8a1903af5","amp;dn":"Heat+Exchangers+-+A+Practical+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2ae6e4d8dda91fd2a8712bd6a493de8a1903af5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,174,110,77,141,218,145,253,42,135,18,189,106,73,61,232,161,144,58,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
