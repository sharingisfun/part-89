Cruise and Kidman play William and Alice Harford, a physician and a gallery manager who are wealthy, successful, and travel in a sophisticated social circle; however, a certain amount of decadence crosses their paths on occasion, and a visit to a formal-dress party leads them into sexual temptation when William is drafted into helping a beautiful girl who has overdosed on drugs while Alice is charmed by a man bent on seduction. While neither William and Alice act on their adulterous impulses, once the issue has been brought into the open, it begins a dangerous season of erotic gamesmanship for the couple, with William in particular openly confronting his desire for new sexual experiences. What didn't make the final cut of Eyes Wide Shut may have been as fascinating as what finally appeared on screen: Harvey Keitel was replaced almost immediately by Sydney Pollack, while Jennifer Jason Leigh was replaced by Marie Richardson after she had shot all her scenes and left town.\n\n\n\nSTARS.........: Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman \nWRITER........: Stanley Kubrick, Frederic Raphael\nDIRECTOR......: Stanley Kubrick\nGENRE.........: Drama | Mystery | Thriller\nRATING........: 7.3/10 203,079 votes\nMETASCORE.....: 68/100\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 39mn\nSIZE..........: 5.30GB\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7139181619313d455f41&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\nBITRATE.......: 4000 Kbps (3-Pass)\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\nAUDIO.........: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\nSUBTITLES.....: ARA, ENG, FRE, SPA \nSOURCE........: Blu Ray Remux\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\nENCODE DATE...: 2015-05-09\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img908/4258/yEtrHE.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img908/4258/yEtrHE.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img661/2277/YSFGdO.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img661/2277/YSFGdO.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img901/6590/7RZxuj.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img901/6590/7RZxuj.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSample clip included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2a28df86393c28f5b1006c705e6c0ad98f0696e","amp;dn":"Eyes.Wide.Shut.1999.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2a28df86393c28f5b1006c705e6c0ad98f0696e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,162,141,248,99,147,194,143,91,16,6,199,5,230,192,173,152,240,105,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
