Australia is about to play a key role in this Big Drop. And you need to prepare for it.\n\nIn the late 90s, after the famous meltdown of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund, Jim Rickards was the expert the US Federal Reserve turned to, to save the entire financial system from collapse.\n\nLess well known is Jim's extensive work within the government, where he's been an advisor to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence Ã¢â‚¬â€ which oversees the NSA, the CIA, and 14 other US intelligence agencies.\n\nIn fact, after September 11, he was recruited by the CIA to develop a program to investigate stock market signals that could identify terrorist activities before they occurred (like the bets against airline stocks before 9/11).\n\nBecause of his deep knowledge of international banking and the interplay of world currencies, the Pentagon called him when they conducted their first ever financial 'war game'. Jim's role was to advise the intelligence agencies on how America could defend against other countries launching covert financial warfare attacks against the US banking system.\n\nBut right now he's predicting an even bigger global financial crisis Ã¢â‚¬â€ only this one will smash down on Australia in ways the last one did notÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nIt's rare to get a globally-recognised market guru of Jim Rickards' nature to swoop down and focus on a country and economy like Australia. In his books, conferences and TV appearances he tends to stick to the mega-big picture.\n\nBut something has changed in the last few months. Australia has become a key part of that big picture in a way it just wasn't before. It's critical you know what that part is. And that you prepare your investments accordingly, before it's too late.\n\nA secret anti-American dollar strategy which one of the world's shrewdest and richest investors is using right now. The last time the US dollar took a tumble like the one Rickards is expecting, one stock in this strategy soared 1,305%\nJim Rickards' 'Barbell Strategy' for positioning your assets during The Big Drop. It gives you protection at both ends during a global tug-of-war between inflation and deflation.\n\nAn 'insurance investment' that could jump as high as 500% if the US Federal Reserve tries to save the system again, like it did in 2008\nThe one safe haven where elites will hide their money during The Big Drop. When elites and institutional investors see a catastrophe coming, this is the first thing they look to buy\nThat's just a taste of what you'll find in The Big Drop.
