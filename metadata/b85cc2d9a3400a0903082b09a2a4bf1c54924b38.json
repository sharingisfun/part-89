She reacts rather indifferently and returns home to her highly-strung mother and begins to new era of her life taking care of a completely ungrateful and insulting mother (declining an offer of marriage from her boss). After a barrage of verbal abuse and offensive remarks from her mother who see's her as an 'ugly old spinster' she accepts a proposal of marriage from an equally insulting and disrespectful man, Helmuth. They honeymoon in Italy. While there Helmuth resigns Martha from the job that she loves, sends her mother to a mental institution, and lets his wife get horribly burnt in the sun while sleeping, then painfully rapes her. Martha gets back to Germany to find that Helmuth has rented them a new house, and she will not be able to return to her old home even to collect any of her things, which he says must be left behind her.\n\n\n\nSTARS.........: Margit Carstensen, Karlheinz BÃƒÂ¶hm, Barbara Valentin\nDIRECTOR......: Rainer Werner Fassbinder\nWRITERS.......: Cornell Woolrich (story)\nGENRE.........: Drama\nRATING........: 7.7/10  1,297 votes\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070374\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 54mn\nSIZE..........: 1.65GB\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e0a8898788a0acd3ced1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)\nRESOLUTION....: 748x572\nBITRATE.......: 1842 Kbps (CRF 18)\nFRAMERATE.....: 25 fps\nAUDIO.........: German AC3 2.0 224 kbps\nSOURCE........: PAL DVD\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, ITA \nCHAPTERS......: Yes\nENCODED BY....: Sartre","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b85cc2d9a3400a0903082b09a2a4bf1c54924b38","amp;dn":"Martha.1974.DVDRip.x264.AC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b85cc2d9a3400a0903082b09a2a4bf1c54924b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,92,194,217,163,64,10,9,3,8,43,9,162,164,191,28,84,146,75,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
