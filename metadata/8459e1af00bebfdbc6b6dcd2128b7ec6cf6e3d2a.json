Try the spicy crab salad, grilled eggplant with spicy chile sauce, jerk chicken, kimchi fried rice or a rack of lamb with harissa crust.\n\nNo matter how high you turn up the heat in your cooking, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy these family-friendly recipes and more in Make it SPICY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8459e1af00bebfdbc6b6dcd2128b7ec6cf6e3d2a","amp;dn":"Make+It+Spicy+-+Amy+Machnak+%28epub%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8459e1af00bebfdbc6b6dcd2128b7ec6cf6e3d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,89,225,175,0,190,191,219,198,182,220,210,18,139,126,198,207,110,61,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
