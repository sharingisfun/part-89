Even if you are unaware of how, or when, and even whom you may have wronged, chances are there is someone out there who wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ever forget it... or you. Simon and Robyn are a young married couple whose life is going just as planned until a chance encounter with an acquaintance from SimonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high school sends their world into a harrowing tailspin. Simon doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t recognize Gordo at first, but after a series of uninvited encounters and mysterious gifts prove troubling, a horrifying secret from the past is uncovered after more than 20 years. As Robyn learns the unsettling truth about what happened between Simon and Gordo, she starts to question: how well do we really know the people closest to us, and are past bygones ever really bygones?\n\nDirector: Joel Edgerton\n\nWriters: Joel Edgerton\n\nActors: Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, Joel Edgerton\n\nGenre: Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7fbc54802738f4006e6e567c18455cdbb12f52","amp;dn":"The+Gift.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7fbc54802738f4006e6e567c18455cdbb12f52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,127,188,84,128,39,56,244,0,110,110,86,124,24,69,92,219,177,47,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
