Once you enter the underworld you have to deal with all the consequences - you are not the only one out there looking for decent loot. Hide in the shadows of the dark, savage city. Sneak into old ruins, haunted cathedrals and mansions of the rich. Incapacitate your enemies quietly or in an open fight. This unique sneak-em-up game provides you with a range of means to achieve your goal. Remember though - secrecy is your best friend.\n\nTHIEFÃ¢â€žÂ¢ GOLD is a first-person perspective stealth game. It was the first game to use light and sound gameplay mechanics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ different surfaces cause varying noise (for example carpets are quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud). You can use sound to your advantage - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only your main source of information on how close your enemies are but you can use it to distract them, for example by throwing objects. With unscripted levels, and objectives and paths altered based on difficulty settings, THIEFÃ¢â€žÂ¢ GOLD can give you hours of non-repetitive gameplay.\n\n\nFeatures:\n==========\nTHIEFÃ¢â€žÂ¢ GOLD includes THIEFÃ¢â€žÂ¢ THE DARK PROJECT and the GOLD update (three new campaign missions which deepen the plot and five new types of enemies).\nAn immersive stealth experience from a first person perspective, allowing direct confrontation if desired.\nPioneer of the stealth game genre for the PC and the first game to use light and sound gameplay mechanics.\nUnique atmosphere of tension powered by ubiquitous darkness and suspense.\n\n\nVersion:\n=========\nLatest game version as of today or GOG setup 2.0.3.49 (after applied patch)\n\n\nInstructions:\n==============Run Setup and Install (don't run before patching)\nRun Patch and Update\nPlay - Enjoy - Seed!\n\n\nEssential improvements:\n========================Mod versions are the newest as of today. \n1.
