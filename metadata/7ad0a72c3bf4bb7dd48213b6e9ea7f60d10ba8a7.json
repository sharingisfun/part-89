It can be easily deployed over the business \ninfrastructure to unite the entire company's offices and other locations \ninto one internal IM workspace with control over messaging groups, user \npermissions to view others and send messages and documents, a message \nand transfer archive with printing support. \n\nSince the server stores and delivers offline messages and files, users \nnever lose information they are supposed to receive. Messaging is \nencrypted with strong algorithms so personal and group conversations are \nsafe and secure even if data is sent via the Internet. Users can send \nmessages with formatted text, links and graphic emoticons (smileys), \norganize their personal Contact Lists, access their contacts from any \nworkplace and see who is online and available for communication. \nThe client software can be configured on the server to run in the \nConfirmation Mode, which means that the client pops up every time a new \nmessage is received and keeps the window on top until the user confirms \nthe message. \n\nTo crown it all, Bopup Communication Server is fast to deploy and easy \nto use. It has a great and flexible user interface and comes with a \nbuilt-in messaging system for scheduled and planned user notifications \nincluding the File Distribution system that offers a managed \ndistributing documents to users.
