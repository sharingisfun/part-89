Hayley Mills, John Mills, James MacArthur\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058691/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058691/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSimple old fashioned family entertainment; no pretensions, no darkness or nastiness, no bad language or sex, just old fashioned family entertainment. That pretty much says it all about The Truth About Spring because watching it now it comes across as a bit of nostalgic family entertainment which relies on its cast to provide entertaining characters rather than anything else.\n\nTommy Tyler is a crafty old seadog who along with his tomboy daughter Spring sail around the Caribbean where if they are not searching for buried treasure are putting on an act to con food and supplies from passing ships. In need of help Tommy brings aboard William Ashton, a young lawyer, to help with the search and defend their little ship from rivals. But Tommy also has other plans as he tries to do a bit of matchmaking between his young daughter and the educated and well off young man.\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x460, 24.080 fps, 1850 Kbps, 01h42m51s\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo\n\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4x6az5797/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4x6az5797/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/3r2b0ciyj/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/3r2b0ciyj/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6wmwqk1kr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6wmwqk1kr/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/nmyafvzzv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/nmyafvzzv/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/de5ta2by3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/de5ta2by3/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9c6f9396ff24d95fba8ddbfb07ef9c04ce42bfd","amp;dn":"The+Truth+About+Spring+-+1965+%28Hayley+Mills%2C+John+Mills%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9c6f9396ff24d95fba8ddbfb07ef9c04ce42bfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,198,249,57,111,242,77,149,251,168,221,191,176,126,249,192,76,228,43,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
