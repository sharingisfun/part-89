However! I don't know about you guys be I'm pretty used to having CD 3 mixed as a single mp3 file. Well guess what? I decided to take care of that for you. Using Mixcraft 6 and &quot;6pack1204&quot;'s upload, I've carefully and to the best of my ability (I say that because SOME of the songs were split in such a way that they don't mix the greatest.) To mix them all up for ya! I even tagged it up like the original mixs so that its track number 43 so you can add it to your download from 6 pack :) Hope you enjoy! And...you know what to do when its 100% right? Thats right! Leave it seeding! :D PEACE!\n\n-OutpostX9 (Contributing random shit to thepiratebay.se)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adda976339384504acbab98f3d25648ef2655f3d","amp;dn":"VA+-+Future+Trance+Vol.+69+CD+3+%28MIXED%29-OutpostX9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adda976339384504acbab98f3d25648ef2655f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,218,151,99,57,56,69,4,172,186,185,143,61,37,100,142,242,101,95,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
