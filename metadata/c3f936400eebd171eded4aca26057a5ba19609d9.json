Dimian, Costin Sorin Bildea (Wiley-VCH, 2008).pdf\n\nISBN 9783527314034\n\nThis practical how-to-do book deals with the design of sustainable chemical processes by means of systematic methods aided by computer simulation. Ample case studies illustrate generic creative issues, as well as the efficient use of simulation techniques, with each one standing for an important issue taken from practice. The didactic approach guides readers from basic knowledge to mastering complex flow-sheets, starting with chemistry and thermodynamics, via process synthesis, efficient use of energy and waste minimization, right up to plant-wide control and process dynamics. The simulation results are compared with flow-sheets and performance indices of actual industrial licensed processes, while the complete input data for all the case studies is also provided, allowing readers to reproduce the results with their own simulators. For everyone interested in the design of innovative chemical processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f936400eebd171eded4aca26057a5ba19609d9","amp;dn":"Chemical+Process+Design+-+Computer-Aided+Case+Studies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f936400eebd171eded4aca26057a5ba19609d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,249,54,64,14,235,209,113,237,237,74,202,38,5,122,91,161,150,9,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
