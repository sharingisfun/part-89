Rather than setting forth an overwhelming list of facts to be memorized, this book engages readers with a fascinating account of the connections between human anatomy and a wide array of scientific disciplines, weaving in the latest advances in developmental and evolutionary biology, comparative morphology, and biological engineering. Logically organized around a few key concepts, The Scientific Bases of Human Anatomy presents them in clear, memorable prose, concise tabular material, and a host of striking photographs and original diagrams","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be20e5e072f98b03ee29d1bbb454d0589cb7b17c","amp;dn":"The+Scientific+Bases+of+Human+Anatomy+-+Charles+Oxnard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be20e5e072f98b03ee29d1bbb454d0589cb7b17c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,32,229,224,114,249,139,3,238,41,209,187,180,84,208,88,156,183,177,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
