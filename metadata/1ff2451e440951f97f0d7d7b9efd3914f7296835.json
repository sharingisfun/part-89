It was released in North America in an edited version as The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula, and alternatively known as The Seven Brothers and Their One Sister Meet Dracula.[1][2] The film is notable for having an actor other than Christopher Lee portray Count Dracula in the Hammer Dracula series: before this film was made, Lee left the role of the Count. The role of Dracula is played by John Forbes-Robertson (though the actor's voice is dubbed by David de Keyser)\n\n\n\n\nPDHorror strives to bring you the best in rare horror in the public domain.
