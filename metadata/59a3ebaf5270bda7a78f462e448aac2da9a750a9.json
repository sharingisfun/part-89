Part of the New Hollywood wave of filmmaking, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential filmmakers in cinema history. In 1990, he founded The Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to film preservation, and in 2007 he founded the World Cinema Foundation. He is a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award for his contributions to the cinema, and has won an Academy Award, a Palme d'Or, Cannes Film Festival Best Director Award, Silver Lion, Grammy Award, Emmys, Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and DGA Awards.\n\nScorsese's body of work addresses such themes as Italian-American identity, Roman Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, machismo, modern crime, and gang conflict. Many of his films are also notable for their depiction of violence and liberal use of profanity. He has directed landmark films such as the crime film Mean Streets (1973), the comedy-drama Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), the vigilante-drama Taxi Driver (1976), the biographical sports drama Raging Bull (1980), the black comedy The King of Comedy (1983), and the crime film Goodfellas (1990), all of which he collaborated on with actor and close friend Robert De Niro. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the crime drama The Departed (2006). With eight Best Director nominations to date, he is the most nominated living director, and is tied with Billy Wilder for the second most nominations overall. Scorsese has also been noted for his collaborations with actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert DeNiro, having directed them in five and nine films, respectively.\n\n        A Companion to Martin Scorsese\n  \tA Goodfella's Guide to New York\n  \tA Third Face_ My Tale of Writing, Fighting and Filmmaking\n  \tBoardwalk Empire\n  \tBringing Out the Dead\n  \tCape Fear\n  \tCatching the Wolf of Wall Street\n  \tConversations with Scorsese\n  \tGangster Priest_ The Italian American Cinema of Martin Scorsese\n  \tGangsters and Goodfellas\n  \tHollywood's Italian American Filmmakers\n  \tHollywood's New Yorker\n  \tHollywood Under Siege\n  \tItalian and Irish Filmmakers in America _ Ford, Capra, Coppola and Scorsese\n  \tKazan on Directing\n  \tMartin Scorsese's Raging Bull\n  \tMartin Scorsese Presents The Blues\n  \tMartin Scorsese _ A Biography\n  \tPsycho-Sexual\n  \tScorses by Ebert\n  \tShutter Island\n  \tSilence\n  \tStreet Smart\n  \tThe Age of Innocence\n  \tThe Double and The Gambler\n  \tThe Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro\n  \tThe Gangs of New York\n  \tThe Last Temptation of Christ\n  \tThe Philosophy of Martin Scorsese\n  \tThe Pocket Essential Martin Scorsese\n  \tThe Snowman\n  \tThe Wolf of Wall Street\n  \tWiseguy\n  \tWiseguy_ Life in a Mafia Family","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59a3ebaf5270bda7a78f462e448aac2da9a750a9","amp;dn":"An+Assortment+of+Books+Related+to+Martin+Scorse+%5Bepub%2C+pdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59a3ebaf5270bda7a78f462e448aac2da9a750a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,163,235,175,82,112,189,167,167,143,70,46,68,138,172,45,169,167,80,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
