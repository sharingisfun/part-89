Pointing to a skills gap, employers argue applicants are simply not qualified; schools aren't preparing students for jobs; the government isn't letting in enough high-skill immigrants; and even when the match is right, prospective employees wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t accept jobs at the wages offered.\n\nIn this powerful and fast-reading book, Peter Cappelli, Wharton management professor and director of WhartonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Center for Human Resources, debunks the arguments and exposes the real reasons good people canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get hired. Drawing on jobs data, anecdotes from all sides of the employer-employee divide, and interviews with jobs professionals, he explores the paradoxical forces bearing down on the American workplace and lays out solutions that can help us break through what has become a crippling employer-employee stand-off.\n\nAmong the questions he confronts: Is there really a skills gap? To what extent is the hiring process being held hostage by automated software that can crunch thousands of applications an hour? What kind of training could best bridge the gap between employer expectations and applicant realities, and who should foot the bill for it? Are schools really at fault?\n\nNamed one of HR MagazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Top 20 Most Influential Thinkers of 2011, Cappelli not only changes the way we think about hiring but points the way forward to rev AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job engine again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9233e257e53e68ce9223db56404b22f5e95e83bb","amp;dn":"Why+Good+People+Can%27t+Get+Jobs+by+Peter+Cappelli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9233e257e53e68ce9223db56404b22f5e95e83bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,51,226,87,229,62,104,206,146,35,219,86,64,75,34,245,233,94,131,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
