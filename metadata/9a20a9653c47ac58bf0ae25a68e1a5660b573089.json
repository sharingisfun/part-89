Justin Sane (vocals/guitar), Andy Flag (bass/vocals), and Pat Thetic (drums) bopped around their hometown much to the dismay of skinheads while recruiting a following who proudly wore torn-up upside-down flags as patches. In 1997, after releasing a handful of singles, opening for their idols the U.K. Subs, the Exploited, and the Circle Jerks, and briefly touring the East Coast -- which led to the departure of Andy Flag -- Die for the Government was released, and 20,000 copies, four bassists, and four North American tours later, Anti-Flag gained their reputation for recapturing the old-school ethics of punk: fast, loud, obnoxious, and anti-everything that ends with an &quot;ism.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a20a9653c47ac58bf0ae25a68e1a5660b573089","amp;dn":"Anti-Flag+-+American+Spring+%282015%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a20a9653c47ac58bf0ae25a68e1a5660b573089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,32,169,101,60,71,172,88,191,10,226,90,104,225,165,102,11,87,48,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
