Welcome to the very specialist world of Audax, where just completing the route equals success. The Highlands, Glens and Western Isles ride is the toughest ever to be staged in the UK.\n\nAdventure Show cameras followed nearly 30 exceptional cyclists day and night as they attempted to cover 1,300 kilometres in just four and a half days. For many that meant abandoning food, sleep and normal life. Having to be entirely self reliant resulted in an Audax at its most exciting and cruel!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf1a20092c38d4fc5e423e7db1c84797c30cc53","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Adventure+Show+%26quot%3BSore+in+the+Saddle%26quot%3B+Audax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecf1a20092c38d4fc5e423e7db1c84797c30cc53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,241,162,0,146,195,141,79,197,228,35,231,219,28,132,121,124,48,204,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
