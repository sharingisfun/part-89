He kills some of them while gay bad-guy Sanchez Boon shakes down someone from &quot;The Agency.&quot; Boon rips a microphone out of the man's jaw with a pair of pliers and shoots him, going way overboard in the tooth-gnashing evil department, evidently so the audience will forget that he was Ponyboy from The Outsiders. Then there's a lot more shooting and Maxwell slides down the supermodels' table on his stomach with both guns blazing. He grabs one of the women, throws some explosives, and rappels them from the roof to safety as more people shoot at them. Then someone blows up a helicopter with a rocket-launcher. This is all before they even get sent to the main location (a remote outer-space prison colony) with a topless cyborg and the mayhem really begins.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 23.976 fps, 1485 Kbps, 01h36m41s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\n\nappears to be DVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/46ca5mvzv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/46ca5mvzv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/b5qc4zvy3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/b5qc4zvy3/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4gjsozam3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4gjsozam3/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/o289l6d17/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/o289l6d17/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/a6019agsb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/a6019agsb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwith thanks to RL, April 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbc36176dfce7b3574bf57b1988c095affa94887","amp;dn":"Sleeping+Dogs++%281998+-+Canada%29++bad+B+movie+science+fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbc36176dfce7b3574bf57b1988c095affa94887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,195,97,118,223,206,123,53,116,191,87,177,152,140,9,90,255,169,72,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
