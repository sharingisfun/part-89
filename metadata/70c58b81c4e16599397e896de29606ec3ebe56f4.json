Celebrating three decades in publication with a special 30th anniversary edition, this classic work reminds us to learn &quot;that we are a part of nature, not a transcendent species with no repsponsibilities to the natural world.&quot; It is time again to listen to Vine Deloria Jr.'s powerful voice, telling us about religious life that is independent from Christianity and that reveres the interconnectedness of all living things.\n\nVine's books influenced our generation and are as important to United States culural history as are books by Norman Mailer and Tom Wolfe. This will be appreciated by future generations when U.S. history ceases to be fabricated for the glory of the white man. In God is Red Vine explains how Christianity is the root cause of this great weakness of the United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â€the inablity to respect to respect or tolerate those who are different. Clearly, this weakness of the United States has only worsened in recent years, with wars against former allies Manuel Noriega, Saddam Hussein, and Osama Bin Laden...God is Red should be read and reÃ¢â‚¬â€œread by Americans who want to understand why the United States keeps losing the peace, war after war. Ã¢â‚¬â€ from the forward by Leslie Marmon Silko, author of Ceremony.\n\nDeloria, a prominent Native American educator, lawyer, and philosopher, has updated his classic work on native religion. In God is Red Deloria argues convincingly that Christianity has failed today's society, and describes basic tenets that underlie Native religions. His other works include Behind the Trail of Broken Treaties and Custer Died for Your Sins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70c58b81c4e16599397e896de29606ec3ebe56f4","amp;dn":"Vine+Deloria+Jr.+-+God+Is+Red+%282003%29+%5Bpdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70c58b81c4e16599397e896de29606ec3ebe56f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,197,139,129,196,225,101,153,57,126,137,109,226,150,6,236,62,190,86,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
