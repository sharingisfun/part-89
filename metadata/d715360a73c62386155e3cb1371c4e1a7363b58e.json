(You can also rename)\n- Double click &quot;Restore_M_to_USB.pkg&quot;, select the USB flash/hdd you erased as target and click install.\nIt will restore the iATKOS M dmg image to your USB device. It can take up to 200 minutes according to your hardware.\n\nWindows:\n- Use Transmac to restore the iATKOS M dmg file to your USB device. It will also take long to finish the restore operation, raw write to USB takes long on any platform.\n\nI advice you to use a USB3 device/port, mine restores in 5 minutes.\n\ncheers\n\nuphuck","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d715360a73c62386155e3cb1371c4e1a7363b58e","amp;dn":"iAtkos+M+%28MacOS+10.9.1+Mavericks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d715360a73c62386155e3cb1371c4e1a7363b58e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,21,54,10,115,198,35,134,21,94,60,177,55,28,78,26,115,99,181,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
