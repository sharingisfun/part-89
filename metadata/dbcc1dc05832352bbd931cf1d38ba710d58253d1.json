A couple of years ago BitTorrent (the company that owns Ã‚ÂµTorrent) decided to experiment with bringing Torrent support to the browser using a version of Ã‚ÂµTorrent that runs without a User Interface, called Torque, and then kind of abandoned it. (frankly, it kinda sucked)\n\nThe promise it made was beautiful though, so I reverse engineered it, and took it to the next level when I found out that the protocol it talks is embedded in the Ã‚ÂµTorrent and BitTorrent clients to this day. \n\nAll that the code does on this page is connect to your Ã‚ÂµTorrent client and change the relevant hidden settings.\n\nSo, what's the catch?\n\nThere is no catch, this is free and effortless because this is the way BitTorrent built their application. It's been a public secret for years that it is possible to do this. If you want to find out more, you can read about it on the Ã‚ÂµTorrent forums\n\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\nPlease Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack\n\nPLEASE SEED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
