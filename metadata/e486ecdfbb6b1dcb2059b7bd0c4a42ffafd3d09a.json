Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering.  I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\n\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation.  Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e486ecdfbb6b1dcb2059b7bd0c4a42ffafd3d09a","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+041-050","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e486ecdfbb6b1dcb2059b7bd0c4a42ffafd3d09a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,134,236,223,187,107,29,203,32,89,183,189,12,74,66,255,175,211,208,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
