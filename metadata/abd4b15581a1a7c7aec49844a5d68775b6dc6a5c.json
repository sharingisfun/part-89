Covering the main industrial operations of dry solids processing, the second part offers insight into the operation principles of the most important technologies that handle dry solids in bulk. With an emphasis on two-phase and multiphase flow, the final part describes all of the relevant systems in industrial processes that combine two different components of the state of matter as well as technologies for separating phases by purely mechanical means.\n\nThrough clear explanations of theoretical principles and practical laboratory exercises, this book provides an understanding of the behavior of powders and pulverized systems. It also helps readers develop skills for operating, optimizing, and innovating particle processing technologies and machinery in order to carry out industrial operations, such as centrifugation, filtration, and membrane separations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abd4b15581a1a7c7aec49844a5d68775b6dc6a5c","amp;dn":"Unit+Operations+of+Particulate+Solids+-+Theory+and+Practice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abd4b15581a1a7c7aec49844a5d68775b6dc6a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,212,177,85,129,161,167,199,174,196,152,68,165,214,135,117,182,220,106,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
