Emphasizing inactivation of microorganisms through the application of traditional as well as newer and novel techniques and their combinations, the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chapters cover:\n\nthermal food preservation techniques (e.g., retorting, UHT and aseptic processing),\nminimal thermal processing (e.g., sous-vide processing), and\nnon-thermal food preservation techniques (e.g., high pressure processing and pulsed technologies).\n\n\n\nEditors Tewari and Juneja give special emphasis to the commercial aspects of non-conventional food preservation techniques. As the most comprehensive and contemporary resource of its kind, Advances in Thermal and Non-Thermal Food Preservation is the definitive standard in describing the inactivation of microorganisms through conventional and newer, more novel techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f66be3fd5f24671246ae365182a081a8bc05af8","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Thermal+and+Non-Thermal+Food+Preservation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f66be3fd5f24671246ae365182a081a8bc05af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,102,190,63,213,242,70,113,36,106,227,101,24,42,8,26,139,192,90,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
