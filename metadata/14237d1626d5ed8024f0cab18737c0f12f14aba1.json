Re-mastering's a really amazing thing. That was the musical point of it all, because there's so much there that you wouldn't have heard before. It was like discovering stuff, because the advances in mastering are so immense since the last time [the Clash catalogue] was remastered in the 90s.&quot;\n\nAll the music has been remastered from the original tapes, Jones said. &quot;We had to bake the tapes beforehand Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the oxide on them is where the music is, so if you don't put them in the oven and bake them, that all falls off, because they're so old.&quot;\n\nBassist Simonon highlighted a guitar line on &quot;Safe European Home&quot;, from the band's second album Give 'Em Enough Rope, saying he'd never even heard it before. &quot;It's probably some session musician, while I was asleep,&quot; Jones joked","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14237d1626d5ed8024f0cab18737c0f12f14aba1","amp;dn":"The+Clash+-+Give+%27Em+Enough+Rope+%281978%29+-++2013+Sound+System+re-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14237d1626d5ed8024f0cab18737c0f12f14aba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,35,125,22,38,213,237,128,36,240,202,177,135,55,192,241,47,20,171,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
