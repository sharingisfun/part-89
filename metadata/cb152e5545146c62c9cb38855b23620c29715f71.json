He plays Kees Popinga, an unhappy, deferential clerk who finally snaps after his unscrupulous boss (Herbert Lom) plunders the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funds Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and PopingaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life-savings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to spoil his mistress (Marta Toren). Popinga has often watched trains passing by, heading for exotic places. So, leaving Lom floating in a canal, he hops on a train bound for Paris, with a suitcase of cash and a plan to track down Toren. On his trail is a Parisian inspector, played by Marius Goring with an engaging blend of warmth and panache. \n\nFrom then on, nothing is quite what it seems, as Rains wanders unsuspectingly into a hellish, vividly-photographed netherworld of accented hoods, bombed-out cars and duplicitous females, the constant rat-a-tat of passing trains echoing in his ears. \n\nThis is a fine addition to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s crime canon: a parable about repression, greed and compromised dreams, with a devastatingly bitter streak. And RainsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ central performance recalls his explosive supporting turn in an earlier Noir classic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Where Danger Lives. \n\nThe film is also known as The Paris Express and was directed by Harold French. It's based on one of SimenonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest romans durs. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an incredible novel and contains one of SimenonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite themes--a bourgeois mild-mannered protagonist who through some fluke, some twist of fate, derails from his respectable life. Once cast adrift from respectability and the treadmill of duty, responsibility and employment, SimenonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters typically escape into an entirely new life, usually in the grimy underbelly of the crime world. For these characters, criminality becomes a liberating event as they shed old habits and routines.\n \nRains became the first actor to receive a million-dollar salary, 1945,when he portrayed Julius Caesar in Gabriel Pascal's high-budget version of Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra.He was also married six times.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 537mb\nDuration.... 01:17:15\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 720\nFrame Height.... 544\nData Rate.... 842kbps\nFrame Rate.... 24F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 125kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb152e5545146c62c9cb38855b23620c29715f71","amp;dn":"The+Man+Who+Watched+Trains+Go+By+1952+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb152e5545146c62c9cb38855b23620c29715f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,21,46,85,69,20,108,98,201,203,56,133,91,35,98,12,41,113,95,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
