The show stars Barbara Stanwyck, as the widow of a wealthy nineteenth century California rancher. It was created by A.I. Bezzerides and Louis F. Edelman, and produced by Levy-Gardner-Laven for Four Star Television.\n\n\n All the previous versions of episodes 16-30 of Season 2 of The Big Valley that I have seen, were lacking in quality. However, I recently found this good quality version on YouTube. The only slight problems with these videos are the black bars on the sides and the fact that I think the aspect ratio should be 2:1. The aspect ratio can quite easily be altered when using VLC Media Player.\n\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cfc1c36b5a5c24d3c0c2da394f01385bf691064","amp;dn":"The+Big+Valley+-+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cfc1c36b5a5c24d3c0c2da394f01385bf691064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,252,28,54,181,165,194,77,60,12,45,163,148,240,19,133,191,105,16,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
