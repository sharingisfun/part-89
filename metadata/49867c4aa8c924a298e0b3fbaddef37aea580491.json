She was bright and pretty, and her\nfuture held endless possibilities. Then she met a man, who turned out to be a wolf,\nand together they built a family. Hana loved her mate fiercely, but fate took him\nfrom her, leaving her alone with two unusual kids she didn't know how to raise.\nFrightened of being discovered, Hana and her wolf children fled to the countryside\nto build a new life. Raising her little wild things was an adventure. It left Hana\nbruised, scratched, exhausted, and joyously overwhelmed as her pups grew stronger\nand wandered further every day. This is a mother's journey. Teach your children\nto chase their dreams-and smile through the tears as they disappear into the world\nin search of who they will become. Hana wasn't always a mother, but it was always\nwhat she was meant to be.\n\nVideo\nVideo Source: Blu ray\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\n\nAudio\nCodec: AC3\nTrack 1: English 5.1ch\nTrack 2: Japanese 5.1ch\n\nSubtitles\nEnglish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49867c4aa8c924a298e0b3fbaddef37aea580491","amp;dn":"Wolf+Children+%28BDRip+1080p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49867c4aa8c924a298e0b3fbaddef37aea580491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,134,124,74,168,201,36,162,152,224,179,251,173,222,243,122,234,88,4,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
