This is the conclusion of the vintage era of Avengers which let Brian Michael Bendis start the Avengers and most of the Marvel Universe over from scratch.\n\nIt paved the way for Civil War and every other universe defining storyline to follow.\n\nAlso in this torrent is the House of M series as well as The New Avengers #26.\n\nWhy would I do this?\n\nBecause this torrent is really called &quot;That Time They Killed Hawkeye Dead.
