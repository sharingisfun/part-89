By Halloween of that year, she was gaining notoriety as her lushly-colored gutpunch of a horror comic, &quot;His Face All Red,&quot; made the rounds.  And in June 2011, she won the Joe Shuster Award for Outstanding Web Comics Creator.  Her gorgeous, twisted short stories have earned her widespread acclaim; they pay homage to classical styles of illustration while gradually building up terrifying twists, psychologically-disturbed characters, and endings that will haunt the reader's dreams.\n\nThe CBR file in this torrent collects the comics and illustrations available (as of May 2015) on Emily Carroll's Web site, representing her online output from 2010 through 2014.  It also includes the story &quot;Our Neighbor's House,&quot; which appeared in her 2014 print collection, &quot;Through the Woods.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e25d9039003b7cc21f8600dc6e14dcf6a427468c","amp;dn":"Emily+Carroll%27s+Online+Comics+%7BWebComixFan%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e25d9039003b7cc21f8600dc6e14dcf6a427468c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,93,144,57,0,59,124,194,31,134,0,220,110,20,220,246,164,39,70,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
