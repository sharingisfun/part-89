According to this theory, an incredibly powerful explosion about 13.7 billion years ago started the present universe. Prior to this explosion, matter, energy, space, and time did not exist. All of these physical phenomena emerged from an unimaginably small, infinitely dense object that scientists call the initial singularity. Immediately after the big bang event, the intensely hot universe, which consisted of pure energy, began to expand and cool. As the universe cooled, matter began to form, initially as primeval quark-gluon plasma. Energy of Matter presents the most important intellectual achievements and technical developments that led people to use matter's energy content more efficiently. Supported by full-color illustrations and interesting sidebars, this new book describes the transformation of matter into energy and vice versa and how it continues in the present","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:765a60cb87ad0dd6bd9be9b091e9980fd167864d","amp;dn":"Energy+of+Matter+%28Facts+on+File%29+%282011%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"765a60cb87ad0dd6bd9be9b091e9980fd167864d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,90,96,203,135,173,13,214,189,155,233,176,145,233,152,15,209,103,134,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
