The Ã¢â‚¬Å“carry on regardlessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ subtext is reinforced by a quiet, almost bittersweet musical arrangement, through which HollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multi-tracked harmony vocals shine as bright as uncried tears. \n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title track Wooden House has a sweet, wistful feel and a hint of an Americana influence. James Ã¢â‚¬ËœHutchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Hutchinson adds some well-placed yet unobtrusive bass to counterpoint HollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s banjo. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a highlight of the album, not least for its chorus, which is an insidiously hooky thing that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find yourself humming for hours. All in all this is a song with massive potential for Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll excuse my lapse into DJ Smashy and Nicey territory Ã¢â‚¬â€œ heavy rotation in nationwide drivetime radio slots. \n\nHollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s knack for catchy hooks again comes to the fore in Building You The Ark, particularly with the perfectly-placed multi-tracked call-and-response harmonies in the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closing section. A syncopated acoustic guitar and quietly pattering rhythm section keep the song moving while its lyric of reassurance is tantalisingly ambiguous: Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m building you the ark, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be all rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, she sings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but to herself or to another? \nReview \nRating \n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist: \n01.
