To use this theme you need a compatible rom with new CM theme engine. It have been tested in CM and xhdpi/xxhdpi devices. I recommend to use with CM, otherwise it may contain missed stuff (contact me and I'll try to fix it too).\nAs first version, it still may contain some little bugs, but, in that case, they will be fixed in future updates. In future updates, I'll also add new stuff, like navbar, etc.\n\nI would like to thank DJDarkknight96 for his help, support and patience. :)\n\n---------------------------\nInstructions:\n\n0. Make sure you are running the latest CyanogenMod 11.\n1. Install APK.\n2.
