Ten tracks recorded on a forty-dollar music \n\nprogram that came with his laptop, with David singing directly into the computer. As in the Papa M singles of last year, \n\nthe record features some traditional songs references, but more often, the songs seem to be coming from a singular, \n\nrootless space.\n\n\nPajo is David Pajo, creator of the bands M, Aeriel M, and Papa M and former member of the iconic rock band Slint. This moody-broody side project, a one-off recorded on the music software included with his laptop, is solid enough to make him come off as a bit of a showoff. How many artists could whip up something this contemplative and cohesive on such cheap equipment? Yet the songs' content cancels inclinations to categorize him as a Moby style megalomaniac. &quot;High Lonesome Moan&quot; and &quot;Ten More Days&quot; dole out glinty guitar work that hints at hope amid serious desperation, and the beautiful,\nhushed &quot;Manson Twins&quot; sounds like something Simon &amp; Garfunkel never got around to recording. If you notice a single, borrowed sound surfacing more than others on &quot;Pajo,&quot; it's that of Elliott Smith. His trademark gorgeous ruefulness is stitched artfully through nine of this CD's 10 tracks. -Tammy La Gorce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f581c2efb82a5aa781a84963993170d05e31ca","amp;dn":"Pajo+-+2005+-+Pajo+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f581c2efb82a5aa781a84963993170d05e31ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,245,129,194,239,184,42,90,167,129,168,73,99,153,49,112,208,94,49,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
