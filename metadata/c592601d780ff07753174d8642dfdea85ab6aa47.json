It was the only to feature guitarist Justin Marler, who would leave the band to become an Orthodox monk. \n\nThe album features &quot;a darker sound and stronger doom metal influence&quot; than later LP's Ã¢â‚¬ËœHoly MountainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœDopesmokerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nA hypnotic strangeness envelops all of the music, making this listening experience quite an engrossing trip. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heavy both musically and lyrically. No matter how many times you listen to it, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never discover all of its secrets. \n\nAn excellent debut.\n\n\n\nSleep\n\nVolume One\n\n1991\n\n \n\n  CD / 1991 / VBR-V0\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.\tStillborn\n\n2.\tThe Suffering \n\n3.\tNumb \n\n4.\tAnguish \n\n5.\tCatatonic \n\n6.\tNebuchadnezzar's Dream \n\n7.\tThe Wall of Yawn \n\n8.\tPrey\n\n9.\tScourge\n\n\n\nSleep:\n\nAl Cisneros - bass guitar, vocals\n\nMatt Pike - electric guitar\n\nJustin Marler - electric guitar\n\nChris Hakius - drums\n\n\n\nSleep / Volume One / 1991\n\n\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c592601d780ff07753174d8642dfdea85ab6aa47","amp;dn":"Sleep+-+Volume+One+%281991%29+1st+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c592601d780ff07753174d8642dfdea85ab6aa47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,146,96,29,120,15,240,119,83,23,77,134,66,223,222,168,90,182,170,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
