The music, while always catchy and easy to keep up with, maintained firm roots in the jazz tradition, a component that dates back to the American bands of Benny Goodman and GregerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hero, Glenn Miller.\n\nMax Greger was always considered the funkier counterpart to GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other band leaders that included James Last, Bert Kaempfert, Horst Jankowski, Kurt Edelhagen and Roberto Delgado.\n\nThis collection gathers 18 evergreens Greger recorded with his Tanzorchester between 1965 and 1973. \n\nA great party.\n\n\n\nMax Greger\n\nGregerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Groove Party:\n\nMax Greger &amp; His Orchestra Play Hot Tracks For Dancing\n\n2008\n\nRecorded 1965 - 1973\n\n\n \n  CD / 2008 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.\tSpinning Wheel\n\n2.\tSoul House\n\n3.\tWe Can Work It Out\n\n4.\tMemphis Tennessee\n\n5.\tA Hard Day's Night\n\n6.\tSuper Girl\n\n7.\tGood Morning Starshine\n\n8.\tJesus Christ Superstar\n\n9.\tSoul Breeze\n\n10.\tNight Train\n\n11.\tWooly Bully\n\n12.\tHi, Hi, Hi\n\n13.\tEight Days A Week\n\n14.\tBig Train\n\n15.\tLittle Willy\n\n16.\tI Feel Fine\n\n17.\tWalking\n\n18.\tAquarius\n\n\n\nMax Greger &amp; His Orchestra / GregerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Groove Party / 1965 - 1973\n\n\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c739b45ef465e8e0651bd79cf188cdf32b4dd74","amp;dn":"Max+Greger+%26amp%3B+His+Orchestra%3A+Greger%27s+Groove+Party+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c739b45ef465e8e0651bd79cf188cdf32b4dd74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,115,155,69,239,70,94,142,6,81,189,121,207,24,140,223,50,180,221,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
