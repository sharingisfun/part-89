It is second release on the label. They are available in almost every major music store that sells digitally distributed music (amazon, i-tunes, beatport ....).\n    The tunes represent journey in the mind of the guy that made them. Screaming Mind is inspirited by illness of the mind (Yeah he read a lot, did you hear about mechanical and biological thinking? He has) and by moments when you can't do a thing because your mind is making random thoughts that are so loud that make you insane and turning your brain against you. Shattered Dreams are reactions on lost dreams, visions and trust in people. This makes paint full moments in your life, make you impossible to feel free and makes you lost sense in life.    \n   You can listen to bits of tunes here:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/suez/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/suez/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n192kbps mp3 drum and bass\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nsupport artist and buy it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:364765b23ebf4bfce99482f2cdd27f923cd73a91","amp;dn":"Suez+presents+-+On+My+Side+%5B192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"364765b23ebf4bfce99482f2cdd27f923cd73a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,71,101,178,62,191,75,252,233,148,130,242,205,210,127,146,60,215,58,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
