Over ten years and four LPs, The Roots have crafted an organic sound, fusing live instruments with introspective lyrics. Like the now-defunct Tribe Called Quest, among others, you listen to The Roots and you feel that they're doing this for the love of it, which is refreshing in this era of crossover formulas and sample-heavy braggadocio.\n\n&quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, while not as classic as &quot;Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot;, still stands strong amongst The Roots' previous recordings. They take hip-hop in directions rarely taken by mainstream &quot;artists&quot;. Lush orchestrations (see &quot;Act Too&quot;), jungle-style breaks (see &quot;You Got Me&quot;), and explosive guest appearances (see &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, &quot;You Got Me&quot;, &quot;Diedre Vs. Dice&quot;, &quot;Return to Innocence Lost&quot;) are just some of the elements of this masterful recording. Black Thought waxes as philosophical as ever; he easily takes his place as one of the more thoughtful emcees today. He's equally complimented by ?uestlove's fluid drumwork, Hub's consistent bass, and Kamal's keyboard wizardry. Add to the mix impressive rhyming by Malik B. and Dice Raw (who rips it over an improv cello harmony, courtesy of Diedre Murray), Common, Mos Def, Erykah Badu, and a heart-wrenching poem by Ursula Rucker (her third collabo with the group) and you have one of the best albums of the year.\n\nIgnore the charts, ignore the pop stations, ignore the naysayers. In fact, ignore commercial interference altogether. This album is proof that hip-hop is not a lost cause.\n[/quote]\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/zZKUDaJ23G.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Roots, The - Things Fall Apart (MCA 11948)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Roots, The\nAlbum................: Things Fall Apart (MCA 11948)\nGenre................: Rap\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1999 02 23\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 56 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
