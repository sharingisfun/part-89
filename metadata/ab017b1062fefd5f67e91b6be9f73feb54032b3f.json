So what the heck, I went with Home on the first install.\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/choice.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Product key.[/b] In the surest sign yet that this thing is wrapping up soon, this build asks for a product key Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ twice. And if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t provide one, you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t edit certain personalization settings, as with Windows 8.1.\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/color.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Default wallpaper.[/b] The new default wallpaper matches the one we see in Windows 10 Mobile for Phones build 10146, which I think is a nice bit of synchronicity.\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/default-wp.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]A bit of contrast.[/b] IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been complaining about the all-white-nothing-but-white Windows 10 UI for a while now, but it looks like weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re finally starting to see a hint of contrast, especially in universal app windows. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not as much as IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like, but better than before.\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nice.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]New icons.[/b] The icons on the Mail, Calendar, People and Maps tiles have been updated with new designs, similar to what we saw with Music and Movies &amp; TV (previously Videos) in earlier builds.\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/new-icons.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Get Office and Get Skype[/b] icons are in the All Apps list.\n\n[b]Edge[/b] gets a dark theme option.\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dark-theme.jpg[/img]\n\n[b]Fit and finish.[/b] As promised, there are tons of little fin and finish changes in this build, especially to icons, and to some of the apps.\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/fit-and-fin.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]https://www.thurrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/cal-start.jpg[/img]\n\n\nEnjoy,\nashish.k\n(KAT/TPB)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab017b1062fefd5f67e91b6be9f73feb54032b3f","amp;dn":"Windows+10+Home%2FPro+Insider+Preview+Build+10147+en-US+x64+%5BA.K.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab017b1062fefd5f67e91b6be9f73feb54032b3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,1,123,16,98,254,253,95,103,233,27,107,233,247,63,235,84,3,43,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
