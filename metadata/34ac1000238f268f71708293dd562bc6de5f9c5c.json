Child actor Jimmy Hawkins had a small role in the film.\n\n    CAST:-\n    James Mason as Larry Quinada\n    Barbara Bel Geddes as Leonora Eames\n    Robert Ryan as Smith Ohlrig\n    Frank Ferguson as Dr. Hoffman\n    Curt Bois as Franzi Kartos\n    Natalie Schafer as Dorothy Dale\n    Art Smith as Psychiatrist\n\nDirected by Max OphÃƒÂ¼ls\nProduced by Wolfgang Reinhardt\nScreenplay by Arthur Laurents\nMusic by Frederick Hollander\nRunning time 88 minutes\n\nMOVIE PLOT:- Caught (1949)\nYoung model Leonora Eames (Bel Geddes) marries multimillionaire Smith Ohlrig (Ryan). Ohlrig though is deranged and did not marry for love. Eames insists several times that she married for love, but the film suggests that she is deluding herself. When Ohlrig becomes too abusive, she leaves him, penniless, to find a job at a medical clinic in a poor neighborhood and eventually falls for Dr. Larry Quinada (Mason).\n\nDuring a one-night reconciliation with Ohlrig, she becomes pregnant. Ohlrig seeks to use the child as leverage to force Leonora to return to himÃ¢â‚¬â€purely to assert his own power, and not out of any love for her. When he has an attack of angina (the film implies this is psychosomatic), Leonora refuses to help him swallow his medication. Thinking she's caused his death (he actually recovers), she calls Quinada for help and prematurely enters labor. Quinada rushes her to the hospital, but the baby is stillborn. With the baby lost, however, Ohlrig no longer has any leverage over Leonora, and she is now free to divorce him and marry Quinada.\n\n\nBACKGROUND NOTES:-\nIn Block's novel, the character of Smith Ohlrig is based on Howard Hughes. She depicts him as a cruel narcissist, a characterization that OphÃƒÂ¼ls exaggerates in his film. OphÃƒÂ¼ls and Hughes were on unfriendly terms. In 1946, OphÃƒÂ¼ls and Preston Sturges had been fired by Hughes during shooting of Vendetta, finally released in 1950 by RKO Radio Pictures. Caught is considered his revenge against Hughes exacted vicariously through Ryan's character. The film is available in Region 2 (UK) and Region 0 (Spanish) DVD editions.\nReception\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $511,000 in the US and Canada and $265,000 overseas.\n\nCRITICAL RESPONSE:-\nFilm critic Dennis Schwartz liked the film as he discussed director Max OphÃƒÂ¼ls in his review, writing, &quot;The talented German-born filmmaker Max OphÃƒÂ¼ls (La Ronde/Le Plaisir), who fled the Nazis and arrived in America from France in 1941, had wasted time and energy on dumb projects when hired early on in the 1940s by delusional egotistical millionaire Howard Hughes and had been called ugly names behind his back by the reactionary studio boss of RKO. In this film, the filmmaker gets his revenge by having writer Arthur Laurents base the vile fashion-plate millionaire character of Smith Ohlrig, superbly played with a chill by Robert Ryan, on the contemptible mogul with info based on his talks with his women and from his own personal dealings with him. The brilliantly perceptive soap opera film noir is taken from the novel Wild Calendar by Libbie Block. It catches the differences between the dream and real world, and what might happen if your dreams are realized and they turn out to be a nightmare. In this case, a marriage from hell.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 88 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 88 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34ac1000238f268f71708293dd562bc6de5f9c5c","amp;dn":"Caught+%281949%29+Xvid+1cd+-+James+Mason%2C+Barbara+Bel+Geddes+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34ac1000238f268f71708293dd562bc6de5f9c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,172,16,0,35,143,38,143,113,112,130,147,221,86,43,198,222,95,156,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
