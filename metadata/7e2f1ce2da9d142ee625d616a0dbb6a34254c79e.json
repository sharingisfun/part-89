This is when CD technology was just coming out. I bet this CD is worth a whole $3. A great collection of songs. Hope you enjoy. One of my favorite songs of all time is Coffee In Bed. Very soulful and the loss of a good woman is felt. As mentioned this is the 1982 CD not the remastered one put out over a decade later. - Big Papi\n[image=bx1WJN4PYE]\n \nBy J. Carroll VINE VOICE\n[quote]Squeeze crafted some of the catchiest pop songs that nobody ever heard. &quot;Tempted,&quot; Pulling Mussels,&quot; and &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot; are easily three of the better pop songs to come out of that time of flux when the 70's were crossing over into the 80's. Lumped together with a number of &quot;one hit wonder&quot; types of that time period, Squeeze deserved much more success than they achieved. This collection does a nice job collecting their strongest work of the original configurations of the band.\n\n&quot;And here in the bar, the piano has found another nail for my heart.&quot; For anyone who likes their music with intelligence and appreciation for the difficulty of crafting a good meaningful pop song this is some good stuff.[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Squeeze - Singles: 45's and Under\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Squeeze\nAlbum................: Singles: 45's and Under\nGenre................: \nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1982\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
