A much more advanced operating system with far greater productivity, but incredibly easy to use for Linux beginners. Plus expert tech support is free. Robolinux Xfce 7.6.1 is extremely optimized, using only 140 MB of RAM in full composite video. It is very stable and has been fully tested for months. It doesn't require a video driver to be installed when running in full composite graphics mode (which is the default). If you are a Windows user this new streamlined Linux OS will blow your mind because it's so fast, super easy to use and highly reliable. Best of all it runs your favorite Windows apps natively with its built in Stealth VM software.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b76afcc01cf24129b3303fefcfff540e7355cee","amp;dn":"RoboLinux+7.6.1+XFCE+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b76afcc01cf24129b3303fefcfff540e7355cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,118,175,204,1,207,36,18,155,51,3,254,252,255,245,64,231,53,92,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
