Explore the rises and falls, the libel and palimony suits, as this intensely driven man struggles for personal happiness as well as the desire for the title of &quot;Mr. Showmanship.&quot;\n\nVictor Garber turns in a stellar performance as Liberace. The actor obviously studied Liberace's speech patterns. body language, and pianistics, and the results are dazzling: he not only looks and sounds like Liberace, he even sings like him. The film commendably traces Liberace's rise to fame and re-creates milestones in his career (including a careful facsimile of his 1950s TV show).\n\nThis has been ripped from DVD with above average video and audio quality. It's an honest and sincere look into Liberace's life by a handful of talented actors, although the production values of the file are a little lacklustre - at one point I saw the camera, and at another point I saw the shadow of the boom microphone! It's also interspersed with actual Liberace concert footage at times.\n\nRegardless, Liberace: Behind the Music is a heartfelt film and is thoroughly enjoyable. Download, enjoy, and share it!\n\nDVD ripped by KiwiKid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b85562e6651dda832647904c2e110a8fce6ba0ab","amp;dn":"Liberace+-+Behind+the+Music+%281988%29+-+DVD+ripped+by+KiwiKid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b85562e6651dda832647904c2e110a8fce6ba0ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,85,98,230,101,29,218,131,38,71,144,76,46,17,10,143,206,107,160,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
