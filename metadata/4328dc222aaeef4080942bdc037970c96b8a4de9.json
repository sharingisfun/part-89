The format of the show is owned by Sony Pictures and is based on the original Japanese series, which has been sold around the world. The programme has been produced by BBC Manchester since its inception and was first broadcast on BBC Two on 4 January 2005.\n\n  Several entrepreneurs are each allowed an opportunity to present their business idea to a panel of five wealthy investors, the &quot;Dragons&quot; of the show's title, and pitch for financial investment while offering a stake of the company in return.\n\n  All the regular Dragons Den UK episodes from the first 12 series are here. In addition, I have included most of the important special post-season episodes, and I have tried to label these specials so as to best convey what they are about.\n\nInvader97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4328dc222aaeef4080942bdc037970c96b8a4de9","amp;dn":"Dragons+Den+UK+Seasons+1-12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4328dc222aaeef4080942bdc037970c96b8a4de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,40,220,34,42,174,239,64,128,148,43,220,3,121,112,201,107,138,77,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
