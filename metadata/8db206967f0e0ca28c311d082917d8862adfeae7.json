It was Spielberg's eighth film as a director, and was a change from the summer blockbusters for which he had become famous. It is also the first feature-length film in Spielberg's entire career for which John Williams has not composed the music. The film starred Danny Glover, Desreta Jackson, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (in her film debut), Adolph Caesar, Rae Dawn Chong, and introduced Whoopi Goldberg as Celie Harris.\n\nFilmed in Anson and Union counties in North Carolina,the film tells the story of a young African American girl named Celie Harris and shows the problems African American women faced during the early 1900s, including poverty, racism, and sexism. Celie is transformed as she finds her self-worth through the help of two strong female companions.\n\nVIDEO: 720p BLUE RAY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8db206967f0e0ca28c311d082917d8862adfeae7","amp;dn":"The+Color+Purple+1985+720p+brrip.ampelouzos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8db206967f0e0ca28c311d082917d8862adfeae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,178,6,150,127,14,12,162,140,49,29,8,41,23,216,134,42,223,234,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
