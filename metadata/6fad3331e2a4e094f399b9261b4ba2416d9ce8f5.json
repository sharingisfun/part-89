Clearly divided into four major sections, the book covers nanoscale dielectric films for electronic devices, superconformal film growth, electrocatalytic properties of transition metal macrocycles, and the use of synchrotron techniques in electrochemistry. All the chapters offer a concise introduction to the relevant topic, as well as supplying numerous references for easy access to further reading and the original literature.\nThe result is must-have reading for electrochemists, physical and surface chemists and physicists, as well as materials scientists and engineers active in the field of spectroscopic methods in electrochemistry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fad3331e2a4e094f399b9261b4ba2416d9ce8f5","amp;dn":"Electrochemical+Surface+Modification","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fad3331e2a4e094f399b9261b4ba2416d9ce8f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,173,51,49,226,164,224,148,243,153,185,38,27,75,162,65,109,156,232,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
