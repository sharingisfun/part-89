Over time, the kingdom came to be known as Esteria, and its divine history was largely forgotten by all but the descendants of those who once preached the GoddessesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will. The only reminder of this lost lore was a cursed spire at the foot of a giant crater, which locals came to regard as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tower.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nEventually, the men and women who called Esteria their home began mining a uniquely radiant silver from the nearby mountains, and development boomed. Towns were built, and the land became rich with life.\nThen, all at once, monsters began to appear. Only a few at first Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but soon enough, the land was swarming with them, and the Esterians had no choice but to hide in fear, remaining ever vigilant just to stay alive.\nOur story begins with a young man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d heard rumors of these misfortunes, and strove to verify them with his own eyes; a brave swordsman with an adventurous spirit bolstered by his own youthful naivetÃƒÂ©.\nHis name was Adol Christin.\nWith no regard for his own safety, Adol set sail toward Esteria through a heretofore impassable barrier of neverending storms. There, he was destined to become ensconced within a 700 year-old mystery that would ultimately take him to a long-lost land nestled amongst the clouds...\nYs I &amp; II Chronicles+ is the most modernized and up-to-date remake of FalcomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic franchise-spawning action RPGs from 1987 and 1988.
