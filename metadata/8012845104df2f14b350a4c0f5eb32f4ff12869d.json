On top of that, a telegram from the west coast declares that her estranged father is gravely injured, and he wishes to see her. Mercy sets out toward the Mississippi River. Once there, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll catch a train over the Rockies andÃ¢â‚¬â€if the telegram can be believedÃ¢â‚¬â€be greeted in Washington Territory by the sheriff, who will take her to see her father in Seattle.\n\nReaching the Mississippi is a harrowing adventure by dirigible and rail through war-torn border states. When Mercy finally arrives in St. Louis, the only Tacoma-bound train is pulled by a terrifying Union-operated steam engine called the Dreadnought. Reluctantly, Mercy buys a ticket and climbs aboard.\n\nWhat ought to be a quiet trip turns deadly when the train is beset by bushwhackers, then vigorously attacked by a band of Rebel soldiers. The train is moving away from battle lines into the vast, unincorporated west, so Mercy canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t imagine why theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re so interested. Perhaps the mysterious cargo secreted in the second and last train cars has something to do with it?\n\nMercy is just a frustrated nurse who wants to see her father before he dies. But sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to survive both Union intrigue and Confederate opposition if she wants to make it off the Dreadnought alive.\n\n\nRead by GraphicAudio (full cast)\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 256 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8012845104df2f14b350a4c0f5eb32f4ff12869d","amp;dn":"Cherie+Priest+-+Dreadnought+%28The+Clockwork+Century+%232%29+%5BGraphicA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8012845104df2f14b350a4c0f5eb32f4ff12869d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,18,132,81,4,223,47,20,179,80,164,192,245,235,50,244,255,18,134,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
