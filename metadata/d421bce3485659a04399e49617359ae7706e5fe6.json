Both man and machine are at risk from forces conspiring to keep the Civil War going and the money flowing.\n\nBardsley has no choice but to ask his patron, former president Abraham Lincoln, for help. Lincoln retired from leading the country after an attempt on his life, but is quite interested in BardsleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s immense data-processing capacities, confident that if people have the facts, they'll see reason and urge the government to end the war. Lincoln must keep Bardsley safe until he can finish his research, so he calls on his old private security staff to protect Gideon and his data.\n\nMaria Ã¢â‚¬Å“BelleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Boyd was a retired Confederate spy, until she got a life-changing job offer from the Pinkerton Detective Agency. Pinkerton respects her work, despite reservations about her lingering Southern loyalties. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s precisely those loyalties that let her go into Confederate territory to figure out who might be targeting Bardsley. Maria is a good detective, but with spies from both camps gunning for her, can even the notorious Belle Boyd hold the greedy warhawks at bay?\n\n\nRead by GraphicAudio (full cast)\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 256 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d421bce3485659a04399e49617359ae7706e5fe6","amp;dn":"Cherie+Priest+-+Fiddlehead+%28The+Clockwork+Century+%235%29+%5BGraphicAu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d421bce3485659a04399e49617359ae7706e5fe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,33,188,227,72,86,89,160,67,153,228,150,23,53,154,231,112,110,95,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
