Sound too can add life to your layout and we discuss fitting sound to locomotives.\n\nN-Gauge Ã¢â‚¬â€œ both British and American outline have decoders installed in Right Track 9 and Nigel demonstrates the new developments in American N-Scale decoder design.\n\nThe Operation section applies to all gauges and scales and such items as aids to slow running, remote operation, programming on the main and double heading are covered in great detail.\n\nTogether with Right Track 8, this programme provides a complete guide to DCC systems and applications Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whatever scale, gauge or era you model.\n\nIn this 3hr programme we look in detail at layout wiring (power bus and control bus), locomotive sound, lighting, smoke and operational considerations.\n\nContents of the DVD\n\n Locomotive Sound\n Lighting Locos and Coaches\n Steam Loco Smoke\n N Gauge and N Scale\n Baseboard Wiring\n Slow Running\n Double-heading\n Operation\n Programming on the Main \n\nImportant: Resolution = 768 x 576.
