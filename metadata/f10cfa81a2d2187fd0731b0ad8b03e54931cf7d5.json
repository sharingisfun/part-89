Based on an acclaimed 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, Picnic at Hanging Rock is set at the turn of the twentieth century and concerns a small group of students from an all- female college who vanish, along with a chaperone, while on a St. ValentineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day outing. Less a mystery than a journey into the mystic, as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society, WeirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gorgeous, disquieting film is a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day.\n\n- Remastered high-definition digital film transfer, supervised by director Peter Weir, with 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray\n\n\n-\nSize: 22.29 GB\n\nThanks to BT1080HD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f10cfa81a2d2187fd0731b0ad8b03e54931cf7d5","amp;dn":"Picnic+At+Hanging+Rock+1975+1080p+Remux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f10cfa81a2d2187fd0731b0ad8b03e54931cf7d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,12,250,129,162,210,24,127,208,115,27,10,216,176,62,84,147,28,247,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
