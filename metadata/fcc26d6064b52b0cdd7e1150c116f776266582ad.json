A new book, Advanced PID Control builds on the basics learned in PID Controllers but augments it through use of advanced control techniques. Design of PID controllers are brought into the mainstream of control system design by focusing on requirements that capture effects of load disturbances, measurement noise, robustness to process variations and maintaining set points. In this way it is possible to make a smooth transition from PID control to more advanced model based controllers. It is also possible to get insight into fundamental limitations and to determine the information needed to design good controllers. The book provides a solid foundation for understanding, operating and implementing the more advanced features of PID controllers, including auto-tuning, gain scheduling and adaptation. Particular attention is given to specific challenges such as reset windup, long process dead times, and oscillatory systems. As in their other book, modeling methods, implementation details, and problem-solving techniques are also presented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcc26d6064b52b0cdd7e1150c116f776266582ad","amp;dn":"Advanced+PID+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcc26d6064b52b0cdd7e1150c116f776266582ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,194,109,96,100,181,43,12,221,126,17,80,193,22,247,118,38,101,130,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
