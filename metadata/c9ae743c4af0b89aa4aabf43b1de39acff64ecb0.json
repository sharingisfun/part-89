This means there was no cropping so you may see small black bars around the picture's edge. This is exactly what is seen on the DVD source. The problem with cropping MST3Ks is that cropping based on the movie usually over-crops the SOL segments, sometimes a lot. Plus, automatically cropping can pull the picture out of its correct aspect ratio. So these encodes have no cropping, RF=20 constant quality video and AC3 passthru so the audio is identical to the DVD.\n\nHandbrake 0.10.1.6962 20150308\n\nVideo: AVC encode\nWidth 720, Anamorphic Loose, Copping Manual 0 0 0 0\nDeinterlace=Slower\nFPS 29.97 Constant, Preset=Very Slow, Quality RF=20.0\nAudio: AC3 Passthru 192Kbps\n\nSingle = RHINO Solo\nShout = SHOUT Solo\nVol01 to Vol12 = RHINO Volume\nVol13+ = SHOUT Volume\ntitles with subs have them set off by default\nall titles have chapters\n\ns06 Radar Men From The Moon and s07 Serial Variety Pack both have custom chapter points and names since the source had no chapters\n\nBytes.........SEp.[Title].[Volume#|Single].DVDrip.[~subs].mkv\n1,164,777,760 s01.ShortsVolume1.Vol02.DVDrip.mkv\n1,100,846,820 s02.ShortsVolume2.Vol03.DVDrip.mkv\n..938,846,701 s03.ShortsVolume3.Single.DVDrip.mkv\n..704,074,393 s04.MrBsLostShorts.Vol06.DVDrip.mkv\n..216,149,550 s05.AssignmentVenezuela.Vol07.DVDrip.mkv\n1,508,580,538 s06.RadarMenFromTheMoon.Vol25.DVDrip.mkv\n1,314,168,917 s07.SerialVarietyPack.Vol27.DVDrip.mkv\n\nBig thanks to the online MST3K community for the DVD sources, some of which are out of print or hard to find.
