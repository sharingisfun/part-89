The un-informed, as ever, misled by the mullah gave in to public display of rage and rampant chaos ensued. Midst this confusion of an undeniably distressing time for all Muslims, spoke the voice of reason, calm and peace, precisely in line with the teachings of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“prince of peaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ himself, the Holy Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This was the voice of Hadhrat Khalifatul Masih V (may Allah assist him with His mighty help) that unfolded the reality of the Islamic ways and means to respond to injustice; calling for peace, reasoning, endeavour to enlighten the world with the power of the pen and ultimately to always put oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trust in sincere prayers.

These Friday Sermons are being presented in this booklet.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam.
