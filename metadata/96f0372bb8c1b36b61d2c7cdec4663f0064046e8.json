Detailing the industry changes caused by the conversion from CFCs to non-ozone-depleting refrigerants and by the development of microprocessors and new secondary coolants, Industrial Refrigeration Handbook also examines multistage systems; compressors, evaporators, and condensers; piping, vessels, valves and refrigerant controls; liquid recirculation; refrigeration load calculations; refrigeration and freezing of food; and safety procedures. Offering a rare compilation of thermodynamic data on the most-used industrial refrigerants, the Handbook is a mother lode of vital information and guidance for every practitioner in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f0372bb8c1b36b61d2c7cdec4663f0064046e8","amp;dn":"Industrial+Refrigeration+Handbook+%28McGraw-Hill%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f0372bb8c1b36b61d2c7cdec4663f0064046e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,240,55,43,184,193,179,107,97,210,199,205,236,70,99,240,6,64,70,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
