No longer a cop, close to washed up and addicted to pain killers, Max takes a job in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil, protecting the family of wealthy real estate mogul Rodrigo Branco, in an effort to finally escape his troubled past. But as events spiral out of his control, Max Payne finds himself alone on the streets of an unfamiliar city, desperately searching for the truth and fighting for a way out.\n\nFeaturing cutting edge shooting mechanics for precision gunplay, advanced new Bullet TimeÃ‚Â® and ShootdodgeÃ¢â€žÂ¢ effects, full integration of Natural MotionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Euphoria Character Behavior system for lifelike movement and a dark and twisted story, Max Payne 3 is a seamless, highly detailed, cinematic experience from Rockstar Games.\n\nFEATURES\n\nCompatibility Issues\n* Fixed reported issues with needing service packs, compatibility with incorrect OS.\n\nVarious Crashes\n* Fixed a range of issues which could have led to crashes on startup and in-game.\n\nAudio Crash\n* Fixed reported issues of audio dropouts when no audio device was plugged in, or when the headphones/speakers disconnected while in game.\n\nMouse Sensitivity\n* Fixed reported issues of mouse being sluggish, especially in prone and ShootdodgeÃ¢â€žÂ¢.
