In this short ebook, extracted from the updated edition of The Global Minotaur, Yanis Varoufakis, the new finance minister of Greece and a Syriza MP, outlines his economic and political thinking and how he believes Europe can move beyond cuts and austerity.\n\nVaroufakis shows how todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crisis in Europe is one inevitable symptom of a global Ã¢â‚¬ËœsystemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which is now as unsustainable as it is imbalanced. With powerful clarity and conviction, he lays out the options available to us for reintroducing reason into a highly irrational global economic order.\n\nThis is a unique insight into the thinking of a key figure in the Syriza government, who is set to become a hugely influential figure in European politics.\n\n--- ----     ==== -- =    ---  -----        =====    ---- =\n\n\nthanks cntrl+c    anywho, please check my upload of the 'The Global Minotaur .
