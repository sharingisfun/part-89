They bare no relation to one another.\n\nOne of those mostly forgotten but generally really great books that was randomly published over the years by Fantagraphics, D&amp;Q, or the like (or in this case, both of them). Seems to be partly auto-biographical, but is definitely along the lines of the alternative, off-center, creator-centric stuff I usually upload.
