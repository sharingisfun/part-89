The tables in the booklet complement and extend the property tables in the appendices to Stephen Turn s Thermodynamics: Concepts and Applications and Thermal-Fluid Sciences: An Integrated Approach. In addition to duplicating the SI tables in these books it extends the tables to cover U.S. Customary units as well. The booklet also contains property data for the refrigerant R-134a and properties of the atmosphere at high altitudes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab83f38861b1b879df140c6657ad3836e705d49","amp;dn":"Property+Tables+for+Thermal+Fluids+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab83f38861b1b879df140c6657ad3836e705d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,184,63,56,134,27,27,135,157,241,64,198,101,122,211,131,110,112,93,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
