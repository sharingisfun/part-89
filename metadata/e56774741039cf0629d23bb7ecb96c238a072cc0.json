We hear them sometimes, from travelers passing through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice, and he were a real dragon. Of course thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not true: he may be a wizard and immortal, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a man, and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to eat one of us every ten years. He protects us against the Wood, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re grateful, but not that grateful.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAgnieszka loves her valley home, her quiet village, the forests and the bright shining river. But the corrupted Wood stands on the border, full of malevolent power, and its shadow lies over her life.\n\nHer people rely on the cold, driven wizard known only as the Dragon to keep its powers at bay. But he demands a terrible price for his help: one young woman handed over to serve him for ten years, a fate almost as terrible as falling to the Wood.\n\nThe next choosing is fast approaching, and Agnieszka is afraid. She knowsÃ¢â‚¬â€everyone knowsÃ¢â‚¬â€that the Dragon will take Kasia: beautiful, graceful, brave Kasia, all the things Agnieszka isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and her dearest friend in the world. And there is no way to save her.\n\nBut Agnieszka fears the wrong things. For when the Dragon comes, it is not Kasia he will choose","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e56774741039cf0629d23bb7ecb96c238a072cc0","amp;dn":"Uprooted+-+Naomi+Novik","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e56774741039cf0629d23bb7ecb96c238a072cc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,103,116,116,16,57,207,6,41,210,59,183,236,185,108,35,138,7,44,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
