Their introduction coincided with the completion of the electrification from Bournemouth to Weymouth. \n\nThe units were initially used solely on the Weymouth line, but through the 1990s began to be used on the London Waterloo to Portsmouth direct line. Upon privatisation, the whole fleet passed to the South West Trains franchise, and then to Southern. \n\nIn 2008, Southern began a refurbishment programme that saw all Class 442 units pass on to Gatwick Express services between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport, and at peak times to Brighton. \n\nDedicated services between the UK capital and the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second busiest airport began in May 1984 with air-conditioned InterCity Mk3 coaches operated by British Rail. In 2008, Gatwick Express ceased to exist as a separate franchise, being merged into the Southern franchise. \n\nDespite their popularity on Gatwick Express services, all 24 trainsets are due to be replaced by Class 387 units in 2016 with the 5WESÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future still to be determined. \nThe 442 currently holds the world speed record for a third-rail electric multiple unit on conventional rails with 108mph (174 km/h) attained in April 1988, although the designed operational top speed of the units is 100mph (161 km/h). \n\nThe BR Class 442 for Train Simulator reproduces the Gatwick Express service as it operated for Southern from 2008. The five-car units comprise of Driving Trailer Standard (DTS), Trailer Standard (TSO), Motor Luggage Composite (MLC), Trailer Standard Wheelchair (TSW) and Driver Trailer Standard (DTS). \n\n\n\nNOTE----&gt; This only works on the pirated version of Train Simulator 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8200c9bced4ec733470689c6ffd0df8cfe0f5abd","amp;dn":"+Railworks+TS2015+Gatwick+Express+Class+442+%27Wessex%27+EMU+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8200c9bced4ec733470689c6ffd0df8cfe0f5abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,0,201,188,237,78,199,51,71,6,137,198,255,208,223,140,254,15,90,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
