It explains how to evaluate the isotopic composition of light elements (H, C, N, O) in solid, liquid, and gaseous samples of organic and inorganic substances, as well as:\n\nPresents a universal, economical, simple, and rapid technique for sample preparation of organic substances to measure the isotopic composition of carbon\nDescribes how to determine microbial mineralization of organic matter in soil and the effect of exogenous substrates on environmental sustainability\nExamines use of the isotopic composition of n-alkanes from continental vegetation to study the paleoclimate and plant physiology\nProposes a systematic approach to identifying tobacco areas of origin and tobacco products based on data from the isotopic composition of light elements\nDiscusses ways to detect doping drugs and suggests results assessment criteria based on determining reference intervals for endogenous markers\nReviews methods of release of gases from inclusions of rocks and minerals for further implementation of isotope mass spectrometric analysis\nConsiders use of optical isotope analyzers for determining the isotopic composition of carbon in CO2 and of hydrogen and oxygen in water","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc4ae31e9fb746c33685ee5ebec2f0d35fe6437","amp;dn":"Isotope+Ratio+Mass+Spectrometry+of+Light+Gas-Forming+Elements","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc4ae31e9fb746c33685ee5ebec2f0d35fe6437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,196,174,49,233,251,116,108,51,104,94,229,235,236,47,13,53,254,100,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
