(Note: Elder below compares this to Renaissance which is a good description, but it also reminds me of a long lost Curt Boettcher production.)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A surprisingly upbeat record, given the period in which it was done, with elements that manage momentarily to evoke Renaissance in a folky mood. Cut seven years late stylistically, but still a sweet record.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Bruce Elder)\n\nMP3 Format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e1fc990b6a359b50200b1697fc42bcddacbe55","amp;dn":"William+St.+James++-+A+Song+For+Every+Mood+%5B1973%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e1fc990b6a359b50200b1697fc42bcddacbe55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,225,252,153,11,106,53,155,80,32,11,22,151,252,66,188,221,172,190,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
