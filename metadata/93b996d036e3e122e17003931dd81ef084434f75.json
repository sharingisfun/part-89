It is a loose adaptation of Oedipus Rex set in the underground gay counterculture of 1960s Tokyo. The film was released by ATG (Art Theatre Guild) on 13 September 1969 in Japan; however, it did not receive a US release until October 29, 1970. Matsumoto's earlier film For My Crushed Right Eye contains some of the same footage and could almost be seen as a trailer for Funeral Parade of Roses, although a true trailer was also made.\n\nThe film was a major influence on Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange.\n\nBara.no.soretsu.1969.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-MED\n\nLength..............: 1h 44mn\nVideo................: XviD 640x480pix\nFPS...................: 23.976 Fps\nAudio................: AC3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b996d036e3e122e17003931dd81ef084434f75","amp;dn":"Bara+no+soretsu+%281969%29+DVDRip+XviD+AC3-MED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b996d036e3e122e17003931dd81ef084434f75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,185,150,208,54,227,225,34,225,112,3,147,29,216,30,240,132,67,79,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
