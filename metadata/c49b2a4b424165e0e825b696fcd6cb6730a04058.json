It was among the first releases on CD showcasing classic jazz at its best and its release was at the heyday of a new format called compact disc. If you were ever familiar with the earlier broadcast or vinyl sounds of these recordings, you would notice a marked increase of dynamic range and clarity. The remastering produced by Polygram was very well done, considering some of the flaws earlier CDs had and this improvement in mastering was attributed, due in part, to the pressing being done in Germany where digital mastering and pressing was partially pioneered...European that is.\n\nI give Philips and JVC/Sony partial credit for creating this wonderful new format as well. All the tracks on this recording hilights a brief evolution of smooth jazz throughout different time periods up to some pop crossovers and is sure to please anyone regardless of age. This is surely a diamond in the rough and you owe it to yourself to own this compilation. I feel that this is a very pleasing to listen and enjoy for a variety of mature occasions.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/NQoi1DHUmA.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n VA - Jazz Like You've Never Heard It Before (Polygram 819 344)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: Jazz Like You've Never Heard It Before (Polygram 819 344)\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1985\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 52 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size. If you love \nFLAC then you'll know MP3 V0 is your other buddy for going mobile when \nspace and quality are a concern\n\nThe AccurateRip data is embedded in the MP3 tags so you can look at any \ntrack to validate the accuracy of the rip.\n\n- Big Papi\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49b2a4b424165e0e825b696fcd6cb6730a04058","amp;dn":"VA+-+Jazz+Like+You%27ve+Never+Heard+It+Before+%28Polygram+819+344%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49b2a4b424165e0e825b696fcd6cb6730a04058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,155,42,75,66,65,101,224,232,37,182,150,252,214,203,103,48,160,64,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
