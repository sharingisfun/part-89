It includes bin/cue CD image files of the original installation CD.\n\nThis release includes LaunchBox (and DOSBox) which will allow you to easily play\nthe game on modern Windows PCs. No configuration or installation is necessary.\nSimply run LaunchBox.exe and then double-click on the game to play.\n\nIn the far future, gladiator-style blood sports were revived. The hero of the\ngame gets informed of them through an associate, whom he believes to be dead. In\norder to get to the bottom of the mystery, he has to become a player in those\ncruel battles, where only the most ruthless survive. Everyone fights to death,\nbecause the loser's fate is worse than just death - the meat of defeated\ncontestants is used in fast-food burgers...\n\nXS is a first-person shooter that consists entirely of these gladiatorial arena\nbattles, in a certain way simulating deathmatch competitions in a single-player\nframe. The player has to fight through a number of rounds of free-for-all\ncombat, being able to choose two weapons before a match begins. Otherwise, the\ngame follows standard FPS rules, with strafing, jumping, occasional platform-\nhopping, etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f63b611f7b6c0e68cb7f1385b0e7d396f7546a84","amp;dn":"XS+%281996%29+%28PC+Game%29+%28HereticXS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f63b611f7b6c0e68cb7f1385b0e7d396f7546a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,59,97,31,123,108,14,104,203,127,19,133,176,231,211,150,247,84,106,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
