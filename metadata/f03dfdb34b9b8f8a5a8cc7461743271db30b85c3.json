Records.[1] It mixes a number of genres, including psychedelic, folk, baroque, bluegrass, ragtime, show tunes, and experimental rock and pop.[2] It was produced by future Warner Bros. Records president Lenny Waronker.\n\nThe album's material explores unconventional song structures, and lyrically focuses on American history and culture. \n\nAlthough the album was mostly written and composed solely by Parks, Song Cycle features three cover songs: Randy Newman's &quot;Vine Street&quot;, Donovan's &quot;Colours&quot;, and the traditional &quot;Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot;. The subjects of many songs are Southern California locales, including Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Vine Street, Silver Lake Boulevard, and Palm Desert. The lyrics on Song Cycle also reflect Parks' history working in both the film and music industries of Southern California.\n\nUpon its release, Song Cycle was largely raved by critics despite lukewarm sales, and later gained status as a cult album.\n\n\nReview by Jason Ankeny:\nVan Dyke Parks moved on from the Beach Boys' abortive SMiLE sessions to record his own solo debut, Song Cycle, an audacious and occasionally brilliant attempt to mount a fully orchestrated, classically minded work within the context of contemporary pop. As indicated by its title, Song Cycle is a thematically coherent work, one which attempts to embrace the breadth of American popular music; bluegrass, ragtime, show tunes -- nothing escapes Parks' radar, and the sheer eclecticism and individualism of his work is remarkable. Opening with &quot;Vine Street,&quot; authored by Randy Newman (another pop composer with serious classical aspirations), the album is both forward-thinking and backward-minded, a collision of bygone musical styles with the progressive sensibilities of the late '60s; while occasionally overambitious and at times insufferably coy, it's nevertheless a one-of-a-kind record, the product of true inspiration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03dfdb34b9b8f8a5a8cc7461743271db30b85c3","amp;dn":"Van+Dyke+Parks+-+1968+-+Song+Cycle+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03dfdb34b9b8f8a5a8cc7461743271db30b85c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,61,253,179,75,155,143,138,90,140,199,70,23,67,39,29,179,11,133,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
