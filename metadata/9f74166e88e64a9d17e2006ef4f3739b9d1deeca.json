Until James died and left Dale all alone on a self-destructive path through alcoholism to an early grave.\n\nThen one stormy night, the giant tree that had marked JamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grave uproots and Dale finds footprints walking away from the hole beneath it. A killer begins ritualistically murdering young women in the small town of Solagrove, Louisiana where he lives, and though the man in the long black coat sounds a lot like James, it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be James. James is dead; there is absolutely no question about it.\n\nDale is reluctantly dragged into the investigation by his neighbor, the mother of the first victim. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not so sure the killings are really his sort of thing, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s something very familiar about it all anyway and someone has to stop it. Though why does it have to be him?\n\nIn the midst of all this chaos, he suddenly finds himself with a house full: a werewolf in the kitchen, a god crashing on his sofa and a punk rock fallen angel riding shotgun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f74166e88e64a9d17e2006ef4f3739b9d1deeca","amp;dn":"The+Man+in+the+Long+Black+Coat+by+JL+Aarne.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f74166e88e64a9d17e2006ef4f3739b9d1deeca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,116,22,110,136,230,74,157,23,226,0,110,244,243,115,155,157,29,238,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
