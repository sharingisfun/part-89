The original band comprised initiator and main songwriter Chrissie Hynde (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), James Honeyman-Scott (lead guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), Pete Farndon (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Martin Chambers (drums, backing vocals, percussion). Following the drug-related deaths of Honeyman-Scott and Farndon, the band has experienced numerous subsequent personnel changes, with Hynde as the only consistent member, and Chambers returning after an absence of several years.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPacked! is the fifth album by rock group The Pretenders, released in 1990. For this album, the only real member of the group is Chrissie Hynde; no other person is pictured anywhere within the album package, and a rotating cast of session musicians (rather than a set band) is used to back Hynde throughout, effectively making this a solo album by Hynde, only using the Pretenders name to satisfy contractual obligations. However, drummer Blair Cunningham plays on all tracks, though he is not credited as part of the band.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\n\nChrissie Hynde: guitar (1-3,5-11), vocals (1-11), backing vocals (6,7)\n\n\nAdditional Personnel:\n\n\nBlair Cunningham: drums (1-11), backing vocals (1,8)\nTchad Blake: guitar (4,5)\nBilly Bremner: guitar (1-6,8,9,11), backing vocals (1,3,8)\nTim Finn: backing vocals (6)\nMitchell Froom: keyboards (2,4-6,9,11)\nMark Hart: backing vocals (6)\nWill MacGregor: bass guitar (1), backing vocals (1)\nJohn McKenzie: bass guitar (2,5,6,8,10,11), backing vocals (8)\nDominic Miller: guitar (7,10), bass guitar (7), backing vocals (7)\nTeo Miller: backing vocals (3)\nDavid Rhodes: guitar (3,11)\nTony &quot;Gad&quot; Robinson: bass guitar (9), backing vocals (9)\nDuane Verh: bass guitar (4)\nAdey Wilson: backing vocals (3)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e274d7850680df61f993377aebf392f55b7aa5e","amp;dn":"Pretenders+-+Packed%21+%2B+B-Sides+%5B1990%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BDE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e274d7850680df61f993377aebf392f55b7aa5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,39,77,120,80,104,13,246,31,153,51,119,174,191,57,47,85,183,170,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
