The non-title match marked the third and final fight in the BoweÃ¢â‚¬â€œHolyfield trilogy.\n\nAfter the previous fight between the two in which Holyfield was able to regain the WBA, IBF and Lineal heavyweight titles by defeating Bowe via majority decision, Holyfield would face undefeated southpaw Michael Moorer in his first defense. Though Holyfield would knockdown Moorer in the 2nd round, Moorer overcame and was able to earn the victory via majority decision. Bowe, meanwhile, would fight a no-contest against Buster Mathis, Jr. and defeat Larry Donald before capturing the less-regarded WBO Heavyweight Championship by knocking out Herbie Hide. After a successful defense of his tile against Jorge Luis GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Bowe and Holyfield would agree to a non-title rubber match set for November 4, 1995, two years after their previous fight. Holyfield did not want to challenge for the WBO title as he thought it would politically hinder his chances of gaining a match for the WBA, WBC and IBF titles.\n\nVideo from the World Boxing Video Archive.
