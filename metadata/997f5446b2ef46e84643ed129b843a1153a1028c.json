The organ of the Council on Foreign Relations, by which it was founded in 1922, it provides a window on the U.S. foreign-policy establishment. It has an international reputation for its careful and probing analyses of political, economic, and social developments on the world scene. The contributors of these authoritative and scholarly articles are among the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most distinguished journalists, scholars, and statesmen.
