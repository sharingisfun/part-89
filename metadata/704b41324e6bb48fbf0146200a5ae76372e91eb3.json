It also brings improvements for business customers, really accelerates opportunity for developers, and enables device makers to offer lower cost devices.\n\nEasier access to your favorite apps and key controls:\n\nOn the Start screen, on select devices you will now find Power and Search buttons at the upper-right corner next to your account picture. You can now more quickly shut down your PC if you need to and do a search right from the Start screen.\n\nIf you like using the desktop, you will be happy to know that select devices will now boot to desktop as the default setting. And on your taskbar, you can now pin both desktop apps and apps from the Windows Store as well as your favorite websites. You can now pin any app you want to the taskbar so you can open or switch between apps right from the desktop. IGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve got some of my favorite apps like Xbox Music, Skype, Facebook, Flipboard, and Mint pinned to my taskbar. You can also access the taskbar from anywhere when youGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“re using a mouse; you can see the taskbar on any screen by moving your mouse to the bottom edge of your screen. Just click on any of the apps pinned to your taskbar to open or switch to them.\n\nMore familiar mouse and keyboard options:\n\nWeGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ve made it so your mouse works more consistently anywhere in Windows. If you move your mouse to the top of the screen when using a Windows Store app, you will see the familiar Close and Minimize buttons. And as I mentioned above, when you move your mouse to the bottom of the screen in a Windows Store app, the taskbar comes up.\n\nOn the Start screen, if you right-click on an app tile, you will get a context menu next to the app tile that shows you what you can do with the tile, like unpin from Start, pin to the taskbar, change the tile size or even uninstall the app. Right-clicking on an app tile on the Start screen works just like right-clicking on something on the desktop.\n\nSimpler way to find new apps:\n\nAfter installing the update, youGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll find the Windows Store is now pinned to the taskbar by default so you can easily discover new apps (yes, you can unpin it if you donGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t want it there).\n\nAnd after installing new apps, youGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ll notice a message at the lower-left corner of the Start screen that points you to the Apps view so you can see what you recently just installed.\n\nSeamless browsing on all devices:\n\nWith todayGÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s update, Internet Explorer 11 adapts your browsing experience by detecting your Windows device and input type GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ whether an 8-inch touch tablet in portrait mode or a 24-inch desktop with mouse and keyboard. The web is still front-and-center but new design enhancements make your browsing experience feel like it was made just for your device GÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ like the number of tabs on-screen, the size of the fonts and menus. You can also now control when the browser remains on-screen or hides away for full-screen browsing. Check out 22tracksto see these updates in action.\n\nImprovements for business customers: We are introducing several key improvements for businesses such as Enterprise Mode Internet Explorer (EMIE) and extended Mobile Device Management (MDM). EMIE enables Internet Explorer 8 compatibility on Internet Explorer 11 so companies can run existing web-based apps seamlessly on Windows 8.1 devices. And with extended MDM, we are introducing additional policy settings that can be managed with whatever MDM solution an enterprise chooses including whitelisting or blacklisting Windows Store apps and websites. Look for a blog post later today on the Windows for your Business Blog that discusses these in greater detail and a post on the Springboard Series Blogon deployment guidance for the Windows 8.1 Update.\n\nNew low cost devices:With the Windows 8.1 Update, we have enabled our hardware partners to build lower cost devices for Windows such as devices with only 1GB RAM and 16GB of storage that provide customers with the experience they expect from a Windows device without sacrificing performance.\n\nWe have made the Windows 8.1 Update available today for MSDN subscribers, and will begin to roll it out for free to Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1 customers via Windows Update next Tuesday April 8th. For the majority of folks, they will receive the update automatically. If you are still on Windows 8, you can get the Windows 8.1 Update via the Windows Store on April 8th as well.\n\nNOTE: The Windows 8.1 Update will be KB2919355 for those of you interested.\n\nSEEEED !!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704b41324e6bb48fbf0146200a5ae76372e91eb3","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+AIO+20in1+x64+ACTIVATED.+%28EXCELLENT%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704b41324e6bb48fbf0146200a5ae76372e91eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,75,65,50,78,107,180,143,191,1,70,32,10,90,231,99,114,233,30,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
