Albucher, Halle Berry, Vince Cirrincione, Moctesuma\nEsparza, Robert Katz, Joshua D. Maurer\nComposer: Elmer Bernstein\nCinematographer: Robbie Greenberg\n\nThis biography of Dorothy Dandridge follows her career through early days on\nthe club circuit with her sister to her turn in movies, including becoming the\nfirst black actress to win a Best Actress Nomination in 1954 for &quot;Carmen\nJones&quot;, to her final demise to prescription drugs, which was debated whether\nit was suicide or accidental. Brent Spiner plays her faithful manager who\nstood beside her through all of the roller coaster of her career. The film\nalso examines her love affair with director Otto Preminger, which is shown\nto have probably initially helped her career, but later probably led her to\nsome wrong decisions. The film also examines 50's racism as the black star\nis not permitted to use white bathrooms or the Vegas pool. In the first\nsituation, she was given a bathroom cup to pee in. In the second situation,\nthe hotel drained the pool and scrubbed it after she dared put her foot in\nthe water.\n\nLists the film is on\n\nBlack Excellence (Best in Black cinema)\nBond Girls: The Ones That Went Nude\nMr. Skin's              Nude Celebrities\n\nGeneral\nContainer:   Matroska\nRuntime:1h 55mn\nSize:   1.88 GiB\nDXVA:   Compatible\nMinimum settings:Met\n\nVideo\nCodec:  x264\nResolution:716x480 &gt; 716x537\nAspect ratio:4:3\nFrame rate:23.976 fps\nBit rate:2 087 Kbps\n\nAudio           English 2.0ch AC-3 @ 192 Kbps\n\nSubtitles      (Muxed into mkv container)\nSRT - English\n\nChapters\n00:00:00.000 : :&quot;Introducing...&quot;\n00:07:24.861 : :The Date\n00:13:56.919 : :Mrs. Harold Nicholas\n00:22:53.622 : :Lynn\n00:28:07.269 : :Earl Mills\n00:44:27.248 : :A Reading with Preminger\n00:52:57.758 : :Otto &amp; Carmen\n01:05:15.161 : :A Colored Star\n01:18:09.518 : :The Academy Awards\n01:29:26.569 : :The Dennison Mistake\n01:36:06.635 : :&quot;Don't let them look at me.&quot;\n01:42:00.572 : :Back on Track\n01:50:24.242 : :&quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;/Credits\n\nThe world's your peach @TL!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c949a4898f76aa729b93b2ba23c163b98618ab8","amp;dn":"Introducing.Dorothy.Dandridge.1999.DVDRip.x264-HANDJOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c949a4898f76aa729b93b2ba23c163b98618ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,148,154,72,152,247,106,167,41,185,59,43,162,60,22,59,152,97,138,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
