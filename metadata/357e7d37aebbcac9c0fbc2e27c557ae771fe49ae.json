There's not a single original riff on all of their first full album, Nobody Said It Was Easy, mind you, but the band's raunchy guitars and gritty delivery make up for this in spades. And had he not been arrested seemingly every six months for one misdemeanor or another, outlaw frontman Frank Starr may have even challenged Axl Rose for his &quot;king of the bad boys&quot; crown. Starr's whiskey and broken glass vocal style literally ignites the album's best moments, including the title track, &quot;Can't Stop Rockin',&quot; and the incredible &quot;Rockin' Is Ma' Business.&quot; And while &quot;Hot Head lifts its main riff directly from AC/DC's &quot;Rock'n'Roll Damnation,&quot; the slightly more original &quot;Tired Wings&quot; actually received some MTV rotation thanks to its mellower Southern rock vibe and slide guitars. Rounded out by the easy strut of &quot;Moonshine,&quot; the all-out fury of &quot;Lookin' for Trouble,&quot; and the lazy jamming of &quot;I Need a Thrill/Somethin' Good,&quot; this album scores low on originality, but high on honesty and charisma. A sure winner for lovers of no-image, no-class rock &amp; roll.\n\nFLAC\n\nThe Four Horsemen\n\nNobody Said It Was Easy\n\n1991\n\nCD - Artwork included\n\nA1\tNobody Said It Was Easy\t\nA2\tRockin' Is Ma' Business\t\nA3\tTired Wings\t\nA4\tCan't Stop Rockin'\t\nA5\tWanted Man\t\nA6\tLet It Rock\t\nB1\tHot Head\t\nB2\tMoonshine\t\nB3\tHomesick Blues\t\nB4\t75 Again\t\nB5\tLookin' For Trouble\t\nB6\tI Need A Thrill/Somethin' Good","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357e7d37aebbcac9c0fbc2e27c557ae771fe49ae","amp;dn":"The+Four+Horsemen+-+Nobody+Said+It+Was+Easy+%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357e7d37aebbcac9c0fbc2e27c557ae771fe49ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,126,125,55,174,187,202,201,192,251,194,226,124,85,122,231,113,254,73,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
