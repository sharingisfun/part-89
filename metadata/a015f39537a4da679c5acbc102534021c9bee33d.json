The series was recorded in front of a live audience and each 30 minute episode was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 at 1pm, making some of the rude, and occasionally crude jokes rather risquÃƒÂ© for the time of day.\n\nHudd, Emmett, and Whitfield had all worked together on the very long-running radio series The News Huddlines. Holland is a familiar voice in British comedy series, probably best known for his role as Spike Dixon, a holiday rep at the Maplin's holiday camp in Hi-de-Hi!\n\nHudd later appeared alongside Clive Merrison as Holmes, and Andrew Sachs as Doctor Watson in an original radio play in the series The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in 2002.\n\n\n\n\nCast:\nRoy Hudd as Sherlock Holmes\nChris Emmett as Dr. Watson\nJune Whitfield as Mrs. Hudson and other females\nJeffrey Holland as Inspector Lestrade and other males\n\n\nThe Newly Discovered Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes - S01 - E01 - The Case Of The Clockwork Fiend\nThe Newly Discovered Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes - S01 - E02 - The Mystery Of The Obese Escapologist\nThe Newly Discovered Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes - S01 - E03 - The Case Of The Deranged Botanist\nThe Newly Discovered Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes - S01 - E04 - Sherlock Holmes And The Glorious Doppelganger\nThe Newly Discovered Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes - S01 - E05 - Holmes Strikes A Happy Medium\nThe Newly Discovered Casebook Of Sherlock Holmes - S01 - E06 - The Demon Cobbler Of Greek Street\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a015f39537a4da679c5acbc102534021c9bee33d","amp;dn":"Newly+Discovered+Casebook+Of+Sherlock+Holmes+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a015f39537a4da679c5acbc102534021c9bee33d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,21,243,149,55,164,218,103,156,90,203,193,2,83,64,33,201,190,227,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
