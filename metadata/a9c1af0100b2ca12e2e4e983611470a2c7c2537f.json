The real fan has to spend double the money, for just a few different tracks. So I thought to post together two slightly different 35th anniversary releases of the famous Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols:\n1) The Japanese SHM-CD Super Deluxe Release, including 2 CD's and a 36 page booklet (in this download as jpg scans)\n2) The European Box Set - originally including 3CD's, one DVD and one vinyl EP. Unlike the other release, it contains no booklet. This download includes the 3CD's only - no DVD, no vinyl rip.\n\nWhat's the difference, what's similar?\nThe Japanese release is on SHM-CD, the European on normal CD. Both include the same remastered original album, four Single B-Sides and the complete Stockholm Happy House show.\nThe Japanese release includes also three live tracks, recorded in Penzance, Winter Gardens, Cornwall, September 1st, 1977. These three tracks are the only one's not included in the three CD-Box. Therefore the Box Set also includes 17 tracks with demos and outtakes (on CD2) as well as 9 tracks from a show in Norway (on CD3).\n\nNo Fun - max\n\nSex Pistols - Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols\nLabel: Universal UMC - UICY 15182/3\nFormat: 2 Ãƒâ€” CD, Album, Reissue, Remastered, SHM-CD, Super Deluxe\nCountry: Japan\nReleased: 31 Oct 2012\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nThe Original Album Remastered From Original Master Tapes\n1-1 \tHolidays In The Sun \t3:23\n1-2 \tBodies \t3:03\n1-3 \tNo Feelings \t2:51\n1-4 \tLiar \t2:42\n1-5 \tGod Save The Queen \t3:19\n1-6 \tProblems \t4:11\n1-7 \tSeventeen \t2:02\n1-8 \tAnarchy In The U.K. \t3:32\n1-9 \tSubmission \t4:13\n1-10 \tPretty Vacant \t3:17\n1-11 \tNew York \t3:05\n1-12 \tEMI \t3:12\nB-Sides\n1-13 \tNo Feeling \t2:46\n1-14 \tDid You No Wrong \t3:11\n1-15 \tNo Fun \t6:25\n1-16 \tSatellite \t3:59\n\nStockholm, Happy House, Sweden, July 28th, 1977, Full Soundboard Recording\n2-1 \tAnarchy In The UK \t3:51\n2-2 \tI Wanna Be Me \t3:05\n2-3 \tSeventeen \t2:21\n2-4 \tNew York \t3:24\n2-5 \tEMI \t3:26\n2-6 \tSubmission \t4:05\n2-7 \tNo Feelings \t3:05\n2-8 \tProblems \t4:34\n2-9 \tGod Save The Queen \t4:31\n2-10 \tPretty Vacant \t4:14\n2-11 \tNo Fun \t5:29\nPenzance, Winter Gardens, Cornwall, September 1st, 1977 (S.P.O.T.S.
