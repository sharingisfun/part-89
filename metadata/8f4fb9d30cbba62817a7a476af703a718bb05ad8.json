Included is music by Wire, The Marbles, The Bongos, Pylon, The Mumps, Chi P\n\nBorn Klaus Sperber in Essen, Germany, Nomi dressed like an alien, sang like an angel, and electrified new wave-era New York. The classically trained tenor\nmoved to the US in the 1970s. Influenced by Maria Callas, Marlene Dietrich, and 1950s sci-fi films, the &quot;opera-singing pastry chef,&quot; as writer Glenn\nO'Brien described him, developed a unique look and sound that stood apart from every other act to emerge from the East Village. At the height of his fame,\nhe caught the eye of David Bowie, with whom he performed on Saturday Night Live in 1979. Unfortunately, his AIDS-related death in 1983 curtailed any\nchance to reach a wider audience. Andrew Horn's evocative portrait rises above the ordinary by documenting a scene as much as its most original\nparticipant. Aside from a wealth of archival material, The Nomi Song includes interviews with Kenny Scharf and Ann Magnuson (but alas, no Bowie).\n------------------------------\n************************************\nSome websites: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Nomi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Nomi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Nomi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Nomi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thenomisong.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thenomisong.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://klaus.nomi.pagesperso-orange.fr/home_ve.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://klaus.nomi.pagesperso-orange.fr/home_ve.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f4fb9d30cbba62817a7a476af703a718bb05ad8","amp;dn":"Klaus+Nomi+-+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f4fb9d30cbba62817a7a476af703a718bb05ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,79,185,211,12,187,166,40,23,167,164,118,175,112,58,113,139,176,90,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
