Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\nEpisode info:\nParasites are everywhere! They take your money and your freedom. Here's our show:\n\nPOLITICAL PREDATORS: Capitalism is great because it's voluntary. Most of the time, people get rich by helping others. But there are some who use government to force people to give them money. David Boaz of the Cato Institute calls this the &quot;parasite economy.&quot;\n\nBEACH HOUSE BAILOUT: I was once a parasite myself... I fed off you. The government encouraged me to be a parasite, and I took the bait when I built this beach house on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Today I'm smarter and realize this was a scam.\n\nLEGAL PARASITES: Personal injury lawyers are high on my list of the worst kind of parasites. They get rich while doing harm and then claim they are helping us. Often they get 40% of the take!\n\nEATING AWAY AT EDUCATION: Years ago, these protestors came after me because I criticized the teachers union and its 200 pages of rules:\n\nKids learn less in school because public schools are a government monopoly, and government monopolies don't serve their customers well. Charter schools offer an improvement, but they threaten the teachers union.\n\nMY TAKE: For most of history, &quot;experts&quot; said leeches could cure disease. They couldn't really (George Washington died after doctors left leeches on him for 10 hours.) But using them made the experts feel like they were doing something. Similarly, when politicians pass endless rules and spend other people's money, they feel good. They're doing something. But they are parasites.\n\nNotes\nTHESE ARE NOT SCENE RIPS. More episodes coming. \n\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pss on video and AAC (faac) on audio. File size limited to 350MB. (310 video 40 audio.\n\nMedia Info\nGeneral\nComplete name : Stossel.2015.02.06.The.Parasite.Economy.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 351 MiB\nDuration : 41mn 21s\nOverall bit rate : 1 186 Kbps\nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b5fddcd2ddf5f9869b85&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 41mn 21s\nBit rate : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.120\nStream size : 310 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 41mn 21s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 37.9 MiB (11%)\nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b28d3b8afaafae90df69abd0a0337c619bb4c4f","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.02.06.The.Parasite.Economy.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b28d3b8afaafae90df69abd0a0337c619bb4c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,40,211,184,175,170,250,233,13,246,154,189,10,3,55,198,25,187,76,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
