Now, for a limited period only, Muggles too have the chance to discover where the Quintaped lives, what the Puffskein eats, and why it is best not to leave milk out for a Knarl. Proceeds from the sale of this book will go to improving and saving the lives of children around the world, which means that the dollars and Galleons you exchange for it will do magic beyond the powers of any wizard. If you feel that this is insufficient reason to part with your money, I can only hope most sincerely that passing wizards feel more charitable if they ever see you being attacked by a Manticore.\n\nQuidditch Through the Ages\n\n\n\nDid you know that: there are 700 ways of committing a foul in Quidditch? The game first began to evolve on Queerditch Marsh - What Bumphing is? That Puddlemere United is oldest team in the Britain and Ireland league (founded 1163). All this information and much more could be yours once you have read this book: this is all you could ever need to know about the history, the rules - and the breaking of the rules - of the noble wizarding sport of Quidditch.\n\nThe Tales of Beetle The Bard\n\n\n\nThe Tales of Beedle the Bard, a Wizarding classic, first came to Muggle readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attention in the book known as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Now, thanks to Hermione GrangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new translation from the ancient runes, we present this stunning edition with an introduction, notes, and illustrations by J. K. Rowling, and extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore. Never before have Muggles been privy to these richly imaginative tales: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Fountain of Fair Fortune,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WarlockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hairy Heart,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and of course, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Tale of the Three Brothers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But not only are they the equal of fairy tales we now know and love, reading them gives new insight into the world of Harry Potter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da92ab194f4d8722f62ce3b00c53ea612200cd08","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+Specials+-+J.K.+Rowling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da92ab194f4d8722f62ce3b00c53ea612200cd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,146,171,25,79,77,135,34,246,44,227,176,12,83,234,97,34,0,205,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
