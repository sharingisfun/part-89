(Note: Elder below compares this to Renaissance which is a good description, but it also reminds me of a long lost Curt Boettcher production.)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A surprisingly upbeat record, given the period in which it was done, with elements that manage momentarily to evoke Renaissance in a folky mood. Cut seven years late stylistically, but still a sweet record.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Bruce Elder)\n\nMP4 Format","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9551aa7922aa2ac71ba6329d05bbacd2a8e0c2ce","amp;dn":"William+St.+James+-+A+Song+For+Every+Mood+%5B1973%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9551aa7922aa2ac71ba6329d05bbacd2a8e0c2ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,81,170,121,34,170,42,199,27,166,50,157,5,187,172,210,168,224,194,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
