Mose's vocals are wonderful, as always Ã¢â‚¬â€œ extremely witty, with that great balance of New Orleans roots and 60s hipster jazz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ served up in a host of his own wonderful compositions!\n\nBut at some points, the horns step out even more strongly, and get some great solo play of their own Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with excellent work from the obscure Jimmy Reider on tenor sax, a surprisingly great player we wish we knew better Ã¢â‚¬â€œ plus the great Jimmy Knepper on trombone. Some tunes are instrumentals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include the classic&quot;Swingin Machine&quot;, plus &quot;Do It&quot;, &quot;Stop This World&quot;, &quot;Promenade&quot;, &quot;If You're Goin To The City&quot;, and &quot;Saritha&quot;.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
