Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\nEpisode info:\nGOV'T VS. ENTREPRENEURS: Some &quot;Davids&quot; are fortunate to find help from the Institute for Justice, a law firm that takes their cases for free when government really crosses the line. Increasingly, the institute helps fight &quot;civil forfeiture,&quot; which sounds boring, but it's really outrageous: &quot;civil forfeiture is when the police and prosecutors seize property they suspect is connected to a crime. If you are charged with a crime, the government must prove your guilt and provide you an attorney if you can't afford one. But in the upside-down world of civil forfeiture, it's your property that gets charged. You must prove that it isn't guilty.&quot;\n\n&quot;ALIENABLE&quot; RIGHTS: Most people are not lucky enough to get a free lawyer from the Institute for Justice. Environmental inspectors demanded to search inside a building owned by Martha Boneta in Virginia. In North Carolina, government regulators told Marty Kotis, owner of Pig Pounder brewery, he couldn't sell his beer at his own restaurants because of laws designed to protect distributors.\n\nLET THEM DRIVE! In Las Vegas, one in every three cabbies rips off customers by taking a roundabout route from the airport to the strip. This means a longer trip and a higher fare. Uber has an easy solution to this problem: technology that adjusts your fare within an hour and lets them fire drivers who keep scamming customers. But in Nevada (where politicians are cozy with cab companies) Uber was kicked out of town. Instead, politicians &quot;solve&quot; the problem with clumsy regulations which usually fail. I read about this in this blog post by Blake Ross, founder of Firefox.\n\nCOPS &amp; CAMERAS: Cop filmer Antonio Buehler was arrested after he videotaped footage of cops abusing people. Recently he was found not guilty after a cop broke the &quot;Blue Code of Silence&quot; and testified in his favor.\n\nGLOBAL FREEDOM WARS: In America, Goliath often crushes opportunity - sometimes arrests people unfairly- But we at least get to vote for our Goliath. In some other countries, David can't even do that. The Atlas Network helps libertarians around the world who want to gain the rights we often take for granted.\n\nMY TAKE: Unfortunately, when it comes to politics, libertarians are &quot;Davids.&quot; We get stomped on and trashed by Bill O'Reilly.\n\nBut libertarian ideas have been winning. Big government Democrats just got kicked out of office. Today, most Americans say the United States &quot;should mind its own business internationally,&quot; Florida just became the 36th state to legalize same sex marriage, support for school choice is growing, and marijuana is now legal (or soon will be) in four states plus Washington DC. That's all good news! But Goliath still rules and grows. On this program, we Davids will keep fighting him.\n\nNotes\nTHESE ARE NOT SCENE RIPS.
