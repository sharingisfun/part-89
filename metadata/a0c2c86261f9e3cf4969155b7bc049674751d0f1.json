High Pressure Processing of Foods is the landmark resource on the mechanisms and predictive modeling of bacterial spore inactivation by HPP.\n\n2)Title: \tRecent Developments in High Pressure Processing of Food\nAuthor(s):\tNavin K Rastogi (auth.)\nSeries:\tSpringerBriefs in Food, Health, and Nutrition\tPeriodical:\t\nPublisher:\tSpringer US\tCity:\t\nYear:\t2013\tEdition:\t1\nLanguage:\tEnglish\tPages:\t117\nISBN:\t978-1-4614-7054-0, 978-1-4614-7055-7\n\nFruit processing and preservation technologies must ensure fresh-like characteristics in foods while providing an acceptable and convenient shelf life, as well as assuring safety and nutritional value. Processing technologies include a wide range of methodologies to inactivate microorganisms, improve quality and stability, and preserve and minimize changes of fresh-like characteristics in fruit. High pressure as a food preservation technique inactivates microorganisms at room temperature or lower; thus, sensory and nutritional characteristics can be maintained. In recent years, a significant increase in the number of scientific papers in literature demonstrating novel and diversified uses of high pressure processing indicates it to be highly emerging technology. The effect of high pressure technology on the quality and safety of foods will be discussed. Selected practical examples in fruits and vegetables, dairy and meat industries using high pressure will be presented and discussed. A brief account of the challenges in adopting this technology for industrial development will also be included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c2c86261f9e3cf4969155b7bc049674751d0f1","amp;dn":"High+Pressure+Processing+of+Foods+%28IFT%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c2c86261f9e3cf4969155b7bc049674751d0f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,194,200,98,97,249,227,207,73,105,21,91,123,192,73,103,71,81,208,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
