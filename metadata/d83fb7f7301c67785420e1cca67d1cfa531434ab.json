Outside the Wall\n\nPink Floyd played five sold out nights at the Nassau Coliseum on the short but expensive Wall tour in 1980 and 1981. All five were taped from the audience with the final night on February 28th being the most popular show to appear on silver releases.\n\nOn Tearing Down The Wall the Godfather label present the three rare middle shows, February 25th, 26th &amp; 27th. The February 26th show was included on the four disc set on Sigma Your Favorite Disguise (Sigma 23), but the second and fourth concerts from the New York shows are making their silver pressed debuts in this box set.\n\nThe New York concerts were heavily promoted on metropolitan radio, creating a media blitz. All the shows were sold out within five hours. Scalpers were fetching as much as $100 for orchestra seats. At one of the shows 150 fans destroyed the glass in the box office and ran into the Coliseum, blending in with the crowd.\n\nNewspapers published serious articles about the spectacle, offering mixed opinions. Martha Hume in the Daily News wrote that Ã¢â‚¬Å“cannot figure out just what people see in a menopausal British rock band that seems to be contemplating the Guyana solution as the nearest exit from life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOn the other hand, John Rockwell, reviewing the shows in the New York Times, opined that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Wall show remains a milestone in rock history though and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no point in denying it. Never again will one be able to accept the technical clumsiness, distorted sound and meager visuals of most arena rock concerts as inevitableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and concluded that the Wall show will be the Ã¢â‚¬Å“touchstone against which all future rock spectacles must be measured.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAfter the final gig the band hosted a party attended by Carly Simon, Mark Knopfler and other luminaries. Andy Warhol, when asked if he liked the concert, replied Ã¢â‚¬Å“I always felt that the Velvet Underground was a good psychedelic group.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWith all the attention being paid to Pink Floyd with the recent release of the big Ã¢â‚¬Å“immersionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“deluxeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ versions of their catalog, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also an opportunity to discover more of the unofficial tapes in circulation. And as good as the February 28th show is (and sounds), itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice to hear the other New York shows in the best available sound quality.\n\nThe packaging is also excellent. It includes a mini tour program, liner notes, and a button commemorating the gigs. Tearing Down The Coliseum wall is the most impressive Pink Floyd release since Behind The Wall (Stonehenge Records STBX 022/23/24) came out in 1993, which contained the Feb. 28th show along with the Los Angeles rehearsals and Roger Waters live tracks from the early nineties","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d83fb7f7301c67785420e1cca67d1cfa531434ab","amp;dn":"PINK+FLOYD+-+Tearing+Down+the+Coliseum+Wall+%286+CD%29+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d83fb7f7301c67785420e1cca67d1cfa531434ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,63,183,247,48,28,103,120,84,32,225,204,166,125,28,250,83,20,52,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
