He spent most of his life working for the mob as a hit man, a line of work that has left him with few friends, an estranged family and a police investigation always at his back. Jimmy just wants to move on, but when his son shows up as a potential target, he has no choice but to act. To save his sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, Jimmy puts everything on the line and tries to do the right thing for the first time and maybe the last time in his life.\n\n\nRating: 7.0/10 (10707 votes)\nDirector: Jaume Collet-Serra\nWriter: Brad Ingelsby\nStars: Liam Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman, Boyd Holbrook\nRuntime: 114 min\nRated: R\nGenre: Action, Crime, Drama\n\n\nSize: 1700MB\nVideo: MPEG-4 | 1920Ãƒâ€”800 | 2001 Kbps\nAudio: English | AAC 2Ch | 128 Kbps\nRuntime: 1h 54mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4e48b4938f30f2e1095e5d139f2cd7d504e51fc","amp;dn":"Run+All+Night+%282015%29+BRRip+1080p+-+MrKickASS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4e48b4938f30f2e1095e5d139f2cd7d504e51fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,228,139,73,56,243,15,46,16,149,229,209,57,242,205,125,80,78,81,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
