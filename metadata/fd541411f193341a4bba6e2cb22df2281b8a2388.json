A jilted groom. A hastily-organized canoe trip. A pristine river. A deep, dark forest. The strange old woman behind the bait shop should've been a warning, but too much beer dulls the senses. When they stumble upon four beautiful women deep in the woods, it all seems too good to be true. And slowly they realize they'll be lucky to escape alive... Witches' Night is a throwback to the horror classics of the 1970's, and features many of the same elements: well-rounded characters, titillating sexual scenarios, an indelible villain, and a plot that builds slowly and inexorably toward an unforgettable conclusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd541411f193341a4bba6e2cb22df2281b8a2388","amp;dn":"Witches+Night+2007+DVDRip-DeadFilmz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd541411f193341a4bba6e2cb22df2281b8a2388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,84,20,17,241,147,52,26,75,186,110,44,178,45,242,40,27,138,35,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
