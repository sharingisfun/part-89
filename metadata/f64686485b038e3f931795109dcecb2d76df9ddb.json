The material is superb as the silky themes possess a quiet mystery to them, making this one of the ultimate late night albums. Dex's solos are sick and his searching statements on the title track are reason enough to possess &quot;One Flight Up&quot;, which to my mind is Gordon's finest and most underrated album. Dex's cohorts do not dissapoint either as Pedersen, Taylor, and Drew provide rhythm that is both atmospheric and driving. Even Byrd does not disgrace himself as he gives thoughtful solos that are more exciting than usual.\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/06/19/Folder.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Dexter Gordon - One Flight Up (Blue Note 7 84176)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Dexter Gordon\nAlbum................: One Flight Up (Blue Note 7 84176)\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1964 06 02\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 61 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
