All four members had wildly different personalities, as their notorious live performances demonstrated: Keith Moon fell over his drum kit while Pete Townshend leaped into the air with his guitar, spinning his right hand in exaggerated windmills. Vocalist Roger Daltrey prowled the stage as bassist John Entwistle stood silent, the eye of the hurricane. They clashed frequently, but these frictions resulted in a decade's worth of remarkable music. Though it took a while to find their audience, by the late '60s the Who rivaled the Rolling Stones as a live act and in album sales. \n\nGenre................: Classic Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: MCA/Universal\nIncluded.............: Covers, Audio Checker, Log, Cue\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.I Can't Explain\n02.Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\n03.My Generation\n04.The Kids Are Alright\n05.A Legal Matter\n06.Substitute\n07.I'm A Boy\n08.Boris The Spider\n09.Happy Jack\n10.Pictures Of Lily\n11.I Can See For Miles\n12.Call Me Lightning\n13.Magic Bus\n14.Pinball Wizard\n15.I'm Free\n16.See Me, Feel Me\n17.The Seeker\n18.Summertime Blues (Live)\n19.My Wife\n20.Baba O'Riley\n21.Bargain\n\nCD2\n\n01.Behind Blue Eyes\n02.Won't Get Fooled Again\n03.Let's See Action\n04.Pure And Easy\n05.Join Together\n06.Long Live Rock\n07.The Real Me\n08.515\n09.Love Reign O'er Me\n10.Squeeze Box\n11.Who Are You\n12.Sister Disco\n13.You Better You Bet\n14.Don't Let Go The Coat\n15.Another Tricky Day\n16.Eminence Front\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e2e881c2b82b0295937e6aab5d8c7f84fc4fe1","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+The+Ultimate+Collection+%282008%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e2e881c2b82b0295937e6aab5d8c7f84fc4fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,226,232,129,194,184,43,2,149,147,126,106,171,93,140,127,132,252,79,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
