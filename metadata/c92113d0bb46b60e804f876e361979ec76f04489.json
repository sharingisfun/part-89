Make sure that you either BLOCK the software's internet\nconnection with your firewall, or press &quot;Patch&quot; once in the\nKeygen\nIf you choose to do it via pressing the &quot;Patch&quot; button, you won't\nbe able to visit these URLs anymore (which wouldn't be a great\nloss anyway):\n\nmrmc.coolwaremax.com\nupdate.webcammax.com\nwww.video2webcam.com\nclient.msnslide.com\nactivate.webcammax.com\nwebcammax.com\nclient.webcammax.com\n\nIf you though want to visit these pages after pressing the &quot;Patch&quot;\nbutton:\nGo to: %WINDOWS%system32driversetc\nOpen the hosts file in a text editor and delete the aforementioned\n7 lines\nBut keep in mind, without these lines being present in the hosts\nfile, or without using a firewall, you won't be able to activate!\n2. Press Activate in the Software, and then enter *any* text\nstring in the SN Box, as it's going to fail anyway, because we\nblocked it from accessing the internet\n3. You can generate now an activation code using our keymaker\nNote that the unlock code is tied to your computer. The\nprogram will not accept unlock codes generated from keymakers that\nwere executed on a computer different than the one the target\nprogram is intented to be executed on\n4. Fill in the Unlock Code from the keygen\n5. NEVER let the programs access any of the 7 aforementioned\nURLs\n6. ???\n7. Profit!\n\nPs. You might need to close the Software after activating via the\nTask Manager due to an Bug in the Application\n\nThanks for choosing\n(C)hallenge (O)f (R)everse (E)ngineering!: CORE NEWS AND iNFOS: not available\n\nlAYOUt &amp; hEADER bY.
