See Amon's description : \n\n&quot;People have, from time to time, described things I've done as &quot;scores for imaginary movies,&quot; which has always irritated me, but on this occasion it's sort of true. Even so, what I was really trying to do was to interpret a sense of scale, like moving towards impossibly giant objects until they occupy your whole field of vision, planets turning, or even how it can feel just looking up at night. I wanted it to pace very slowly, the way far off objects can seem still until you look away for a while and find they've shifted some distance when you look back. Tracks like Io work in that way; something changing gradually so you barely notice it, until at some point you no longer recognize it.&quot;\n\n\nTracklist : \n\n1. Dark Jovian   \t \n2.
