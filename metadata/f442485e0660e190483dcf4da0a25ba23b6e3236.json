Mixing ingredients of Pop, Soul, Doo-Wop and Garage Rock ballads, it sounds vintage but current, while the Yorkshire lilt in Jones's voice (a result of his hometown, Heckmondwike) places him firmly in the UK, rather than Detroit. Spectrals has always been a small operation. Now in its third year of existence, Jones started by recording in a friend's knocked-together studio and posting the tracks on MySpace. Despite being intended for his closest friends, his songs soon attracted the attention of discerning labels all over the world. \n\n\nReleased in 2011 on Slumberland records\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
