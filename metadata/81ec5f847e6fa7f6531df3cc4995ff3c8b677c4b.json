Artworks in the collection have origins from the former Ottoman empire to Java, and architectural pieces suggest the grandeur of buildings in the Indian tradition. This volume details the cultural and artistic significance of more than 140 featured works, which range from Tibetan thangkas and Indian miniature paintings to stone sculptures and bronzes. Relating these works to one another through interconnecting narratives and cross-references, scholars and curators provide a broad cultural history of the region","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ec5f847e6fa7f6531df3cc4995ff3c8b677c4b","amp;dn":"The+Arts+of+India%2C+Southeast+Asia+and+Himalayas+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ec5f847e6fa7f6531df3cc4995ff3c8b677c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,236,95,132,126,111,167,246,83,29,243,204,73,149,255,60,139,103,124,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
