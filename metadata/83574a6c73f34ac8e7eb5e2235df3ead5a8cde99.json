Powered by proven NOD32Ã‚Â® technology, ESET Endpoint Antivirus delivers proactive malware defense that balances fast scanning with accurate detection in an unobtrusive system footprint so that your business systems have the strong protection they require without needless interruptions to the end user.\n\nKey Features:\n\nSmarter Scanner: Threats donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always enter your network in ways you expect. ESET NOD32 Antivirus inspects SSL-encrypted communication channels like HTTPS and POP3S and intelligently scans compressed files to find hidden threats other products miss. Proactive protection begins at the earliest point in system startup to ensure your computer is always secure.\nClean and Safe Email: Email scanning for Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Mozilla Thunderbird, Windows Live Mail, Windows Mail, and other POP3/IMAP mail clients, ensuring your email is free of viruses and other threats.\nRemovable Media Security: Threats can enter your PC from removable media such as USB thumb drives. For self-running media, ESET NOD32 Antivirus scans autorun.inf and associated files when the medium is inserted, in addition to scanning any file on any removable device when it is accessed, or during a full-scan of the media. Power users can adjust ESET NOD32 Antivirus to perform additional levels of scanning on removable media.\nSystem Tools: ESET SysInspector and ESET SysRescue simplify diagnosing and cleaning of infected systems by allowing deep scans of system processes to find hidden threats, and creating bootable rescue CD/DVD or USB drives to help you repair an infected computer.\nSelf Defense: ESET NOD32 Antivirus has built-in technology to prevent malicious software from corrupting or disabling it, so you can rest assured your system is always protected","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83574a6c73f34ac8e7eb5e2235df3ead5a8cde99","amp;dn":"ESET+Endpoint+Antivirus+5+0+2242","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83574a6c73f34ac8e7eb5e2235df3ead5a8cde99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,87,74,108,115,243,74,200,231,235,94,34,53,223,62,173,90,140,222,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
