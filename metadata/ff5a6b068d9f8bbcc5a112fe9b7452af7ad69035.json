Zumdahl, Susan A. Zumdahl\nFormat: PDF\nHardcover: 1200 pages\nPublisher: Cengage Learning; 9 edition (January 1, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN: 978-1133611097\n\nThis fully updated Ninth Edition of Steven and Susan Zumdahl's CHEMISTRY brings together the solid pedagogy, easy-to-use media, and interactive exercises that today's instructors need for their general chemistry course. Rather than focusing on rote memorization, CHEMISTRY uses a thoughtful approach built on problem-solving. For the Ninth Edition, the authors have added a new emphasis on critical systematic problem solving, new critical thinking questions, and new computer-based interactive examples to help students learn how to approach and solve chemical problems--to learn to think like chemists--so that they can apply the process of problem solving to all aspects of their lives. Students are provided with the tools to become critical thinkers: to ask questions, to apply rules and develop models, and to evaluate the outcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff5a6b068d9f8bbcc5a112fe9b7452af7ad69035","amp;dn":"Chemistry%2C+9th+Edition+by+Zumdahl+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff5a6b068d9f8bbcc5a112fe9b7452af7ad69035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,90,107,6,141,159,139,188,197,161,18,254,155,116,82,175,122,214,144,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
