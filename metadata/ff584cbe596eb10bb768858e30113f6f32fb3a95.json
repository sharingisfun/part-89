The fact that all of the foregoing prophets testify to the truth of Prophet Muhammad constitutes a yet stronger testimony to the truth of Islam and the Unity of religions.\n\nMoses prophesied about Hadhrat Muhammad.\n\nIn Deuteronomy 18:17-19, Moses prophesied:\n\n    &quot;And the Lord said unto me. They have well spoken that which they have spoken, I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.&quot; \n\nThe foretold prophet in this prophecy was not Jesus Christ, nor any other Israelite prophet, because none of them ever claimed to be the prophet promised here. We read in the Gospel of John (1:19-21) that in the time of Jesus, the Jews were expecting the advent of three prophets. Firstly Elias, secondly Christ, thirdly a prophet of such universal fame that in his case no other specification was thought necessary. &quot;The Prophet&quot; was enough to convey what was meant. Jesus claimed to be the Christ and he regarded John the Baptist as Elias (Matthew 11:14, 17:10-13). Further, he prophesied about his second advent in the last days when true faith would disappear from the earth (Luke 18:8).\nHadhrat Muhammad to come before the Second Advent of Jesus\nPeter describing the time of &quot;That Prophet&quot; says:\n\n    &quot;He shall send Jesus Christ which before was preached unto you; whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, a Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.&quot; (The Acts 3:20-22)\n\nThese words of Peter evidently imply that the advent of &quot;that prophet&quot; will take place before the second advent of Jesus Christas. Jesusas pointed out in the parable of the vineyard that after him shall come the Lord of vineyard and added:\n\n    &quot;The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth fruits thereof.&quot; Matthew 21:43\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n\nContact for more details:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/contactus/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOfficial websites:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alislam.org/&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mta.tv/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff584cbe596eb10bb768858e30113f6f32fb3a95","amp;dn":"Mohammed+In+The+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff584cbe596eb10bb768858e30113f6f32fb3a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,88,76,190,89,110,177,11,183,104,133,142,48,17,63,111,50,251,58,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
