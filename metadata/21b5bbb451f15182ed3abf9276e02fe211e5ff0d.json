Founded in the 1970s by Lloyd Barnes, as the Wackie's House Of Music based on White Plains Road in New York, the name Wackies also include a record shop and a studio. It is considered by some to be the first significant reggae studio and label in the United States. [...]\n Most if not all of the original (1970s and 1980s) Wackies recorded releases are out-of-print and in demand among reggae music collectors. Germans Moritz Von Oswald and Mark Ernestus, passionate devotees of the label's sound, have undertaken an extensive and ongoing 12&quot; and LP re-issue campaign for the label through an exclusive imprint in the Basic Channel record label family, bearing the Wackies logo and label design. To date, the imprint has put out work from artists such as Horace Andy, Wayne Jarrett, Love Joys, The Meditations, and Sugar Minott, as well as several strictly dub releases by Wackies-sponsored bands.\n\n Enjoyyyy and Seed !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21b5bbb451f15182ed3abf9276e02fe211e5ff0d","amp;dn":"Wackies+32+CD+%28+Various+Artists+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21b5bbb451f15182ed3abf9276e02fe211e5ff0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,181,187,180,81,241,81,130,237,58,191,146,118,224,47,226,17,229,255,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
