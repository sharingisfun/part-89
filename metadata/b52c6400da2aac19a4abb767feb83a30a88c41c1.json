Sorta.\n\nEffectively it's just the audio from the Bluray copy of the UK Live Arena tour, sliced and diced (as per the MKV's chapter timestamps) into separate tracks. Makes for easier listening.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ In effort to preserve audio quality (DTS 5.1 Surround), I've left them in MKA format.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ In effort to avoid pissing off everyone with a mobile audio player, I've also thrown in a set in WAV format, at some slight cost to quality.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ In effort to skirt doing actual work, I've left out any and all metadata.\n\nFeel free to improve (add track details, album art, convert to 320kbs MP3 Surround, etc.) and reupload. I don't mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b52c6400da2aac19a4abb767feb83a30a88c41c1","amp;dn":"Jesus+Christ+Superstar+-+Live+Arena+Tour+-+2012+%5BWAV%5D+%5BMKA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b52c6400da2aac19a4abb767feb83a30a88c41c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,44,100,0,218,42,172,25,164,171,183,103,254,184,58,48,168,140,65,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
