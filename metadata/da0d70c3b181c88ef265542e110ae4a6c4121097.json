Besides the well-established asymmetric metal-complex-catalysed syntheses and biocatalysis, the use of &quot;pure&quot; organic catalysts turned out to be an additional efficient tool for the synthesis of chiral building blocks. In this handbook, the experienced authors from academia and industry provide the first overview of the important use of such metal-free organic catalysts in organic chemistry. With its comprehensive description of numerous reaction types, e.g., nucleophilic substitution and addition reactions as well as cycloadditions and redox reactions, this book targets organic chemists working in industry and academia, and deserves a place in every laboratory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0d70c3b181c88ef265542e110ae4a6c4121097","amp;dn":"Asymmetric+Organocatalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da0d70c3b181c88ef265542e110ae4a6c4121097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,13,112,195,177,129,200,142,242,101,84,46,17,10,228,166,196,18,16,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
