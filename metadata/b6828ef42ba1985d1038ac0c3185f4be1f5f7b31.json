He lived in South India in the present-day state of Tamil Nadu. Also known by the name Oothukkadu Venkatasubba Iyer, he composed hundreds of compositions in Sanskrit, Tamil and Marathi of which over 500 are available. Venkata Kavi's compositions reveal that he was a complete master of the science and art of music in all senses of the term Ã¢â‚¬â€œ melody, rhythm or lyrics and was eloquent in Sanskrit and Tamil. He was proficient in a variety of musical forms such as the kriti, tillana and kavadichindu. He used talas and themes that not many other Carnatic composers have preferred to handle. His compositions are a blend of a high degree of scholarship on a variety of subjects and inspired expression.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6828ef42ba1985d1038ac0c3185f4be1f5f7b31","amp;dn":"Oothukkad+Venkata+Subbaiyer+Kritis+K.J.Yesudas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6828ef42ba1985d1038ac0c3185f4be1f5f7b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,130,142,244,43,161,152,93,16,56,172,12,49,133,244,190,31,95,123,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
