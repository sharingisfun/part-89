I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t speak Spanish, but, you know, trying to stay hip. Like actually releasing a new version, that sounds like an awesome idea, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it? Hell, v4.5 had so many holes thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been fixed in v4.6, it made 4.5 look like Swiss cheese. And IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure the Swiss have even used this thing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been all the way around the internet and back Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in fact, v4.6 was created on a laptop I bought from a guy on eBay (just shopping around) that uses my disc as well! I was amazed. This thing has seen some mileage.\n\nFalconFour's Ultimate Boot CD v4.6\n\nIn this boot CD are the most popular and useful tools anyone would ever need. The best of the free software, the best of the commercial software, and it all fits on one CD-R thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s readable by any computer worth booting on. Not everything can read a DVD, and USB booting is hit and miss at best.\n\nMeanwhile, since the last release in 2011, more has changed. I wrote off the dry, stale corporate IT world of wastefulness and over-powered, under-utilized systems and unnecessary, poorly planned Ã¢â‚¬Å“cloudÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ services. Currently unemployed (at least, as of this release!), I found some time to put some major polish on MiniXP and get everything working well. Still would love to work in computer repair. Anyone? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll even move. Anything? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?\n\nThis disc, an even more minor single-point revision, is actually a huge MiniXP update. Other tools have been updated, like Memtest86+, which has been replaced with the more frequently updated Memtest86, with a smarter loading mechanism. Tons of updates in MiniXP. AHCI support, for one thing. Better driver support for network and wireless drivers, faster (and more reliable) startup, better error reporting/catching, better graphics, better compatibility with more tools and software, andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Flash support in the latest Portable Firefox! Yes, you can watch YouTube from MiniXP now. And access TeamViewer/LogMeIn which uses Flash. LOTS of work has been put into polishing the startup routine and compatibility.f4ubcd-46-menu\n\nPlenty of features from v4.5: Virtual Floppy enables you to mount images from a USB stick to be used in a boot selection like MiniXP (for F6 SATA/RAID drivers) or FreeDOS (Dell option).
