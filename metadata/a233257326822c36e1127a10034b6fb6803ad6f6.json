I also know it's not on the internet anywhere (I tried so hard to find it earlier) so I think it would be helpful to some of you who also want an electronic version.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nname: Integrated Chinese (Cheng &amp; Tsui) Level 2 Part 2 - Simplified and Traditional Character\nfile format: pdf, mp3\nsize: ~300 Mb\n\nfiles:\nch1.pdf - ch10.pdf\nmisc pdfs\naudio mp3 - both textbook and workbook (mod and original)\n\nFor anyone who wonders, the illustration is different from level 2 part 1 I don't know why. Audio also differs from part 1 (both the people who voice it and the quality). The original audio is so slow and lengthy (7 mins each) that I need to modify it to make it faster and more proper for higher level student. Original file is also included but it's not that good","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a233257326822c36e1127a10034b6fb6803ad6f6","amp;dn":"Integrated+Chinese+Level+2+Part+2+Textbook+%2B+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a233257326822c36e1127a10034b6fb6803ad6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,51,37,115,38,130,44,54,225,18,122,16,3,75,111,182,128,58,214,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
