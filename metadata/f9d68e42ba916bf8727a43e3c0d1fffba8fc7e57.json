It begins with a very gentle Ã¢â‚¬Å“warm-upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stretch and it ends with just-plain-relaxation.  DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be confused by the title; the set isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dark Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s light and airy with brightly glowing candles.  Quiet instrumental music with some soothing nature sounds.  DVD includes a bonus 15-minute workout.\n\nVideo; x264; 706*480 (4:3); 2273 kbps; 29.970 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9d68e42ba916bf8727a43e3c0d1fffba8fc7e57","amp;dn":"Crunch+Candlelight+Yoga+with+Sara+Ivanhoe+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9d68e42ba916bf8727a43e3c0d1fffba8fc7e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,214,142,66,186,145,107,248,114,122,67,227,192,209,255,251,168,252,126,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
