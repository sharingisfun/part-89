The latter was discovered in a doorway close to a local youth club. Pictures specialist Rupert Maas offers his thoughts on the murky world of authenticating illegal graffiti and an artist whose identity is a well-kept secret. \n\nHilary Kay admires a nautilus shell engraved with an image of the city's famous suspension bridge, while ceramics specialist John Sandon wonders if a delftware posset pot might have originated much closer to home. \n\nA large globe clock, once given in lieu of a debt, turns out to be far more significant than its owner could ever have imagined. A late 19th-century automaton of a young French gentleman steals the show by smoking a cigarette, only to be promptly told off by specialist Jon Baddeley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10cba5df35671b2f3e6d13a0d6b0087b62ac204b","amp;dn":"Antiques+Roadshow+S37E24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10cba5df35671b2f3e6d13a0d6b0087b62ac204b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,203,165,223,53,103,27,47,62,109,19,160,214,176,8,123,98,172,32,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
