Following the demise of an earlier, conspicuously synth pop-based outfit named Empire, the Hawkins brothers sowed the seeds of what would become the Darkness at an impromptu karaoke session on New Year's Eve 1999. Justin's rapturous rendition of Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; showed them the way, and the suitably dramatic name of the Darkness was chosen shortly after the arrival of Poullain and Graham. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Canary Dwarf\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Lossless Audio Checker, Cue\n\n\n\n\n01.Barbarian\n02.Open Fire\n03.Last Of Our Kind\n04.Roaring Waters\n05.Wheels Of The Machine\n06.Mighty Wings\n07.Mudslide\n08.Sarah O'Sarah\n09.Hammer &amp; Tongs\n10.Conquerors\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f5d0ed75cdf949d01b4828be36d28e99ca66aa","amp;dn":"The+Darkness+-+Last+Of+Our+Kind+%282015%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f5d0ed75cdf949d01b4828be36d28e99ca66aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,245,208,237,117,205,249,73,208,27,72,40,190,54,210,142,153,202,102,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
