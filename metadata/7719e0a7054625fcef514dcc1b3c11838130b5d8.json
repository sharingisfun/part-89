There are now 56 passengers and 4 crew members still alive on the asteroid, but disasters aboard the ship will cause that number to dwindle. Explainable events are happening more frequently now. There is a mysterious object resembling a green bollard fence, and whoever touches it will vanish; An artificial intelligence has delusions of world conquest. Rumors begin to start about the possible existence of aliens. The Arcturus Corporation will finally make its move and nobody is safe. The survivors will have to be resourceful to survive the terrors. We will learn more about who they are.
