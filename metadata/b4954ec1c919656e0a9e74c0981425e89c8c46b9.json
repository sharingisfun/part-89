The Delpht came in 1994 when guitarists Rodrigo Cruz , Luis Casadio and drummer Alexandre Callari met through mutual friends and , unhappy with their previous joint , decided to form a band . To complete the team , Casadio invited two acquaintances , bassist and keyboardist Marcel Felipe Carvalho Milano . The Delpht name, which is a Viking character was created by the band itself , inspired by the Dutch city Delft , home of painter Werner Van Deft . In 1995 , vocalist Simolla Ronaldo was invited to join the band . Soon after , the character test , the Delpht recorded some tests and began a series of small gigs in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo . Confirming the good moment , the band was invited on an independent label to participate in the compilation &quot; Rock Phalanx II &quot; , in which he recorded two tracks : &quot; A Prayer For The World&quot; and &quot; Lost In The Ocean &quot; . While the song &quot; A Prayer For The World&quot; was included in the program for a few months of 89 FM - SÃƒÂ£o Paulo , in the program &quot; The Time of Brazil &quot; ( dedicated to the underground ) , personal reasons led keyboardist Marcel Milano to leave the group , being replaced by Douglas Baldan. After nearly a year of preparation , the band started in May 1997 recording of the demo-CD &quot; Far Beyond ... &quot; , produced by Marcello Pompeu ( Korzus ) and Delpht own , and in 1998 , Alexander and Ronaldo left for Europe to publicize their work , through Germany , France , Holland, Belgium and England (in the latter , causing a jam in London show guitarist Le Burn) . Back in Brazil , almost musical and personal differences decreed the end of the band , which eventually break apart , leaving only Ronaldo and Alexandre own. Promptly , the duo met new musicians : Daniel Bonanni ( who took both the low as keyboards ) and Patrick Graue ( guitars ) , and started the pre -production to be the first CD. Subsequently , the band inked a deal with record labels Laser Company and Die Hard Records , who agreed to produce work in partnership and in 2000 , finally , the recording of &quot; Screams Of Ice &quot; began . Besides the title track , divided into three parts ( Enemies , The Screams and Revenge ) , which tells the story of the character Delpht , the CD still has the &quot; Ride Of The Valkyries &quot; songs , &quot; Till The End Of Time &quot; , &quot; Are you Still Smiling &quot; , &quot; Professional Puppets &quot; and &quot; Forever In the Unknown &quot; , besides having more special holdings of domestic and foreign musicians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4954ec1c919656e0a9e74c0981425e89c8c46b9","amp;dn":"Delpht+-+Living+in+Fantasy+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4954ec1c919656e0a9e74c0981425e89c8c46b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,149,78,193,201,25,101,110,10,158,116,192,152,20,37,232,156,140,70,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
