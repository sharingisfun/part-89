Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\n\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ad04c969c1d0c3a30cb0cbff080a62622b01e03","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+011-020","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ad04c969c1d0c3a30cb0cbff080a62622b01e03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,208,76,150,156,29,12,58,48,203,12,191,240,128,166,38,34,176,30,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
