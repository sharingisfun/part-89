Peter Grant, who managed the rock band Led Zeppelin, also managed Bad Company until 1982.\n\n Bad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Their first three albums, Bad Company (1974), Straight Shooter (1975) and Run With the Pack (1976), reached the top five in the album charts in both the UK and US. Many of their singles, such as &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot;, and &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;, remain staples of classic rock radio. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBad Company is the debut studio album by British hard rock supergroup Bad Company. The album was recorded at Headley Grange with Ronnie Lane's Mobile Studio in November 1973, and the first release of Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records.\n\nThe album reached the top of the US Billboard 200.[5] Since then, the album has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and became the 46th best selling album of the 1970s. The album spent 25 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, entering at No. 10 and reaching its highest position of No. 3 in the second week. Kerrang! magazine listed the album at No. 40 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.\n\nThe singles &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Movin' On&quot; peaked at No. 5 and No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, &quot;Bad Company&quot; and &quot;Ready for Love&quot; (the last originally recorded by guitarist Mick Ralphs during his tenure with Mott the Hoople on All the Young Dudes) are also &quot;classic rock&quot; radio staples. In 2006 a limited edition CD of 24K gold was released. A previous remaster was released in 1994.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStraight Shooter is the second studio album by British supergroup Bad Company. The album was released in April 1975, a month after the release of the single &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot; and four months before the album's second single &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot; (see 1975 in music).\n\nThe album reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. It was certified gold (500,000 units sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America a month after its release.\n\nMick Ralphs and Simon Kirke revealed on In the Studio (which devoted an episode to Straight Shooter) that the track &quot;Shooting Star&quot; (which told the story of a rock star who died early) was lyrically inspired by the drug and alcohol-related deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRun with The Pack is Bad Company's third album. It was released in 1976.\n\nRun with The Pack was recorded in France with The Rolling Stones Mobile Truck in September 1975 with engineer Ron Nevison and mixed in Los Angeles by Eddie Kramer. The album was the only original Bad Company album not to feature artwork from Hipgnosis as it featured artwork from Kosh instead.\n\nThe album peaked at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart and No. 5 on the US Billboard 200. It has sold to date three million copies in the US alone.\n\nTheir cover of the Coasters single &quot;Young Blood&quot; peaked at No. 20. The album also spawned rock radio classics &quot;Silver, Blue and Gold&quot;, &quot;Live For the Music&quot;, and the title track. Although &quot;Silver, Blue &amp; Gold&quot; remains one of the band's most popular compositions, the song was never released as a single.\n\nThe album was remastered and re-released in 1994. The vinyl had a shiny, silver cover, but CD versions feature a simple, light grey cover.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBurnin' Sky is the fourth album by British rock band Bad Company. It was released in 1977 (see 1977 in music).\n\nBurnin' Sky was recorded in France at ChÃƒÂ¢teau d'HÃƒÂ©rouville in July and August 1976 with future Rolling Stones engineer Chris Kimsey but its release was delayed until March 1977 as to not compete with the band's then-current album Run with the Pack.\n\nThe album peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 and No. 17 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was remastered and re-released in 1994. The cover is similar to the poster for the 1969 Sam Peckinpah film &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. In the movie Almost Famous, the fictitious band Stillwater's first tee shirt is strikingly similar to the Burnin' Sky album cover.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDesolation Angels is a 1979 album by the hard rock band Bad Company. It was their 5th studio release. Paul Rodgers revealed on In the Studio with Redbeard (which devoted an episode to Desolation Angels) that the album's title came from the novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac.\n\nDesolation Angels was recorded at Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey, England in late 1978.\n\nIt is considered the last strong album by Bad Company, mostly because it contains their last major hit, &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy,&quot; written by Paul Rodgers and inspired by a guitar synthesizer riff that Rodgers had come up with.\n\n&quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot;, written by bassist Boz Burrell, also received substantial airplay on rock stations. It was the first of only three songs he ever wrote for the band, but is widely revered as one of the band's finest compositions.\n\nThe album reached No. 3 on the Billboard album charts in 1979 and went Platinum in 1979 and Double Platinum subsequently.\n\nA cover version of &quot;Oh, Atlanta&quot;, written by Mick Ralphs, was recorded by Alison Krauss and appears on her 1995 album Now That I've Found You: A Collection. The original version was used in the open to The Nashville Network's 1993 broadcast of the Motorcraft 500 when ABC (which originally had the broadcast) could not find time to air the race, postponed six days by a snowstorm in the Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\nThe album was remastered and re-released in 1994","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587382e9e3d83afba29061cc8533a4844f1bae71","amp;dn":"Bad+Company%2FOriginal+Album+Series+%5B5CD%5D%5B2014%5D%5B320K%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587382e9e3d83afba29061cc8533a4844f1bae71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,115,130,233,227,216,58,251,162,144,97,204,133,51,164,132,79,27,174,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
