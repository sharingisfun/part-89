They don't put specials up on the site so I had to wait for this to air again. Since they didn't have an episode for a few weeks in a row earlier this month they aired Green Tyranny and some other old eps instead. I got a chance to cap it. Enjoy!\n\n2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nJohn F. Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGREEN TYRANNY W/ JOHN STOSSEL\n\nAirs Sunday at 9pm ET on FNC\n\nOne can love nature but still hate the tyranny the green movement imposes.\n\nSHUTTING DOWN PROGRESS: America is blessed with abundant resources but cursed with boneheaded regulators. Now the EPA has been caught colluding with environmental activists to shut down a mine in Alaska. The Green Tyrants say the mine might hurt fish, but the fish are 90 miles away. Stossel asked Bob Deans of the Natural Resources Defense Council, &quot;are any mines okay?&quot; He didn't name one that the NRDC would approve.\n\nGreen Tyrants opposed to the Keystone pipeline say it will never be finished. Even if President Obama finally approves it, they say, &quot;we will tie it up in court, and get in the way of construction crews.&quot; It makes Stossel wonder why anyone would try to build anything big today. &quot;NIMBY&quot; used to be the chant (Not In My BackYard!). Now it's &quot;BANANA&quot; (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody).\n\nTHE CHURCH OF CLIMATE CHANGE: Global warming alarmism has turned into hysteria. Yes, the globe has warmed. Climate changes! We can adjust to it. But climate scientists who dare say that, like Judith Curry of Georgia Tech, are shunned as heretics.\n\nSEAWORLD: The CNN film &quot;Blackfish&quot; says SeaWorld cruelly imprisons killer whales. SeaWorld's attendance and stock price dropped after they ran the film repeatedly. SeaWorld wouldn't speak to the &quot;Blackfish&quot; producers, but they did speak to us. We investigated and learned that much of &quot;Blackfish&quot; is utter deceit.\n\nPROPAGANDA: &quot;There may be no alternative but to cancel Christmas!&quot; threatens Santa in a Greenpeace video on global warming. Hollywood runs propaganda that tells kids: global warming will kill you! Kids are scared.\n\nZERO IMPACT: All the trash Lauren Singer produced in 2 years fits inside a mason jar. She proudly lives a &quot;sustainable lifestyle.&quot; This makes her feel &quot;empowered,&quot; but such &quot;extreme recycling&quot; is a pointless gimmick only indulged in by privileged people in rich countries--countries made rich by fossil fuels that Green Tyrants now want to ban.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.06.14.SPECIAL.Green.Tyranny.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 348 MiB\nDuration                                 : 40mn 43s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 196 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 40mn 43s\nBit rate                                 : 1 057 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.161\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1057 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 40mn 43s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.3 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65184c7cc0f38a0354e6d63ee28bf0c81b4127c","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.06.14.SPECIAL.Green.Tyranny.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65184c7cc0f38a0354e6d63ee28bf0c81b4127c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,81,132,199,204,15,56,160,53,78,109,99,238,40,191,12,129,180,18,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
