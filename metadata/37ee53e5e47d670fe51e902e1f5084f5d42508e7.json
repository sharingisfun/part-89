In these 12 stories, Raffles is played by Jeremy Clyde. Raffles escapes various close shaves with the law, including a period of posing as an Australian invalid, and each story is nicely self contained.\n\nThe story of Raffles is brought to a satisfactory conclusion at the end of Series 2, but the unlikely personage of Graham Greene was a great fan, and much later revived Raffles in &quot;The Return of A J Raffles&quot;, which was broadcast previously by Auntie Beeb. I found it unsatisfactory as a story, and is not included in this collection of audio dramas.
