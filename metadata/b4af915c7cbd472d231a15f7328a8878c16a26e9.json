Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\nEpisode info:\nTRUST ON THE INTERNET: A website called Task Rabbit now allows people to advertise for things like: someone to come to my house and mop the floor. Or buy my groceries and deliver them. Sounds creepy. Why would I trust a stranger found on the internet? Yet, the free market came up with solutions: It harnessed the power of reputation, and now there are ways to know who to trust on the internet.\n\nPRIVATIZE IT: Margaret Thatcher was right. We should trust private companies far more than government: &quot;The right honourable gentleman takes his customary swipe at private enterprise, he can't stand it. He'd rather have nationalization run by politicians who know nothing.&quot;\n\nMEDICAL ADVICE FROM STRANGERS: A new company called &quot;CrowdMed&quot; advertises: have your medical problems solved... by the crowd. You submit your case... which means listing your medical problems... and offer a reward, usually a few hundred dollars, to anyone who can solve your case. But would you trust an Internet diagnosis like that? Should you?\n\nIN BITCOIN WE TRUST? The $20 billion in your wallet says &quot;In God We Trust,&quot; but right below that is a picture of the White House. Unfortunately, God is not in charge of preserving the value of the dollar... Politicians are. I don't trust them. They have inflated away the value of currencies in country after country. Thankfully, now, there's a private alternative called Bitcoin. But is it any good? It's price has fallen lately.\n\nHOW MUCH TRUST IS TOO MUCH? One coffee shop in North Dakota has no one behind the counter-no one to make sure people pay... they rely on the honor system.\n\nSTOSSEL'S TAKE: Trust the market, and now -- the reciprocal ratings on the internet.\n\nNotes\nTHESE ARE NOT SCENE RIPS. More episodes coming.\n\nMedia Info\nGeneral\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 351 MiB\nDuration : 41mn 6s\nOverall bit rate : 1 193 Kbps\nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;125a7b757a525e213c22&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 41mn 5s\nBit rate : 1 054 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.121\nStream size : 310 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1054 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 41mn 6s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4af915c7cbd472d231a15f7328a8878c16a26e9","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.01.08.Trust.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4af915c7cbd472d231a15f7328a8878c16a26e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,175,145,92,124,189,71,45,35,26,21,247,50,138,136,120,193,106,38,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
