But now, with a breakthrough called &quot;deep learning,&quot; artificial intelligence is finally getting human-like intelligence. The AI redux, Cognitive Computing, is having a transformational impact on work and society as a whole. This quantum leap requires a whole new way of thinking and acting if we are to reap the benefits and understand the potentially catastrophic downsides. The book uses a unique multimedia format with QR codes and tiny URL links that let readers drill down on many of the topics. Leaders in government and business can ill afford to miss this early-warning book. A lot of effort went into making the book concise so that very busy people who have little time to read, the game changers, will have time to grab the essence of this hugely important subject--and act! \n\n\nAuthor: Peter Fingar\nPublisher: Meghan-Kiffer Press\nPublication: December 2, 2014\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7e91e7e12d14b61080fca489641b3727499a29","amp;dn":"Peter+Fingar+-+Cognitive+Computing+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7e91e7e12d14b61080fca489641b3727499a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,126,145,231,225,45,20,182,16,128,252,164,137,100,27,55,39,73,154,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
