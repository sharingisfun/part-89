If you've ever tried to fend for yourself in this alien world, you know that a book like this is long overdue. The Handy Answer Book for Kids addresses nearly 800 queries that only a kid can think up. It's easy to understand and organized by simple topical chapters, permitting kids (and parents) to help themselves. Born in a moment of quiet desperation, it easily handles the occasional solitary stumper lobbed like a live grenade, like How many stars are there? It's more than a bunch. What did people use before toothbrushes were invented? With Handy Kids, love means never having to say I don't know. Chapters include Earth, Sky, and Beyond; Me, Myself, and I; My Family and Friends; Being Green (about the plant world); How Things Work; Home Life and School Days; World Tour; Animal Neighbors; and others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73c1545d88c85120c020eeb0cf558422fc3acea1","amp;dn":"The+Handy+Answer+Book+for+Kids+%28And+Parents%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73c1545d88c85120c020eeb0cf558422fc3acea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,193,84,93,136,200,81,32,192,32,238,176,207,85,132,34,252,58,206,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
