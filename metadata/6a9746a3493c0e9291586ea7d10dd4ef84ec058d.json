Through exploring the current state of the creative industries, the authors show how technologies are reshaping our creative processes and how they are affecting the innovative creation of new products. Readers will discover how creative production processes are dominated by digital data transmission which makes the connection between people, ideas and creative processes easy to achieve within collaborative and co-creative environments. Since we rely on our senses to understand our world, perhaps of more significance is that technologies through 3D printing are returning from the digital to the physical world. Written by an interdisciplinary group of researchers this thought provoking book will appeal to academics and students from a wide range of backgrounds working or interested in the technologies that are shaping our experiences of the future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a9746a3493c0e9291586ea7d10dd4ef84ec058d","amp;dn":"Creativity+in+the+Digital+Age+%5B2015%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a9746a3493c0e9291586ea7d10dd4ef84ec058d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,151,70,163,73,60,14,146,145,88,110,167,209,13,212,239,132,236,5,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
