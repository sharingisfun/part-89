This is just an initial release. Expect bugs. Tested in Yosemite, with working Multiplayer (Just joining, no hosting yet). No maps issues so far... It will be a bit slow at first (for about a minute when entering world), but it fixes right away.\nIf you encounter any bugs, let me know.\nVersion 1.3.0.2 coming soon...\n\nOnce opened, wait a bit. If opened many times, it WILL freeze. (Be patient)\n\nSorry for the file size, I will reduce it next time.\n\nTo change resolution, select the optimum one and change to windowed and then back to fullscreen (or viceversa). It should adjust then.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc58879c5d87581e44c6397756ef60a756687781","amp;dn":"Terraria+1.3.0.1+%28Mac%29+%28bundle%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc58879c5d87581e44c6397756ef60a756687781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,88,135,156,93,135,88,30,68,198,57,119,86,239,96,167,86,104,119,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
