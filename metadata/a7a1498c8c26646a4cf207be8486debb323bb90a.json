There is a real unity in the artist's vision and the way he has chosen to celebrate the people he loved is both moving and haunting. Who can forget those visions of a secretary sitting on the desk and waiting for the boss, and those people in the sun just lying there ,and finally those two women in the restaurant? HOPPER is an artist that really gets to you in a most depressing way. As an introduction to his work, this book is interesting","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a1498c8c26646a4cf207be8486debb323bb90a","amp;dn":"Edward+Hopper%2C+Transformation+of+the+Real+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7a1498c8c26646a4cf207be8486debb323bb90a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,161,73,140,140,38,100,106,76,242,7,190,132,134,222,187,50,59,185,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
