Joel's music consistently demonstrates an affection for Beatlesque hooks and a flair for Tin Pan Alley and Broadway melodies. His fusion of two distinct eras made him a superstar in the late '70s and '80s, as he racked an impressive string of multi-platinum albums and hit singles.\n\nBorn in the Bronx, Joel was raised in the Long Island suburb of Hicksville, where he learned to play piano as a child. As he approached his adolescence, Joel started to rebel, joining teenage street gangs and boxing as welterweight. He fought a total of 22 fights as a teenager, and during one of the fights, he broke his nose. For the early years of his adolescence, he divided his time between studying piano and fighting. Upon seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, Joel decided to pursue a full-time musical career and set about finding a local Long Island band to join. Eventually, he found the Echoes, a group that specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes became a popular New York attraction, convincing him to quit high school to become a professional musician. \n\n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Columbia\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.Piano Man\n02.You're My Home\n03.Captain Jack\n04.The Entertainer\n05.Say Goodbye To Hollywood\n06.Miami 2017 (Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway)\n07.New York State Of Mind\n08.She's Always A Woman\n09.Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\n10.Only The Good Die Young\n11.Just The Way You Are\n12.Honesty\n13.My Life\n14.It's Still Rock And Roll To Me\n15.You May Be Right\n16.Don't Ask Me Why\n17.She's Got A Way\n18.Allentown\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Goodnight Saigon\n02.An Innocent Man\n03.Uptown Girl\n04.The Longest Time\n05.Tell Her About It\n06.Leave A Tender Moment Alone\n07.A Matter Of Trust\n08.Baby Grand\n09.I Go To Extremes\n10.We Didn't Start The Fire\n11.Leningrad\n12.The Downeaster Alexa\n13.And So It Goes\n14.The River Of Dreams\n15.All About Soul (Remix)\n16.Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel)\n17.Waltz #1 (Nunley's Carousel)\n18.Invention In C Minor\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e287fb5ac31b8209a5fbc7413d1c3f34e5ed49","amp;dn":"Billy+Joel+-+The+Essential+%282001%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e287fb5ac31b8209a5fbc7413d1c3f34e5ed49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,226,135,251,90,195,27,130,9,165,251,199,65,61,28,63,52,229,237,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
