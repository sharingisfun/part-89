At the behest of an aging aborigine, Storm Boy takes care of an uncared-for nest of pelicans.\n\nThis is the story of a boy. He is called Mick by his father, Tom (Peter Cummings), and Storm Boy by the Aboriginal loner Fingerbone (Gulpilil) he befriends. He is played marvellously by young Greg Rowe. This boy is growing up in an isolated corrugated iron shed next to a wildlife sanctuary. He lives with his father, who supports them by fishing alone. He is not attending school; he is illiterate and ignorant, and he doesn't know any better. But he seems content with his life, and a little less curious about the outside world than one might expect. There's a telling moment when he brings home a radio that washed up on the beach (he found it while looking for driftwood to burn). His father tells him to throw it away, because if he listens to it, he'll hear advertisements and want things he can't have.\n\n(Text from IMDB--thank you very much--and the included RTF file.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c18a2d6af0dca4015fa96ea95eb6e455fed1e0","amp;dn":"Stormboy%5B1976%5D88m.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c18a2d6af0dca4015fa96ea95eb6e455fed1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,193,138,45,106,240,220,164,1,95,169,110,169,94,182,228,85,254,209,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
