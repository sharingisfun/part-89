He assembled the Ascension Band with four electric guitarists, one bassist, and one drummer. The group included guitarist Lee Ranaldo, who later joined alternative rock band Sonic Youth.[2] The group's bass player knew the owner and engineers at The Power Station, so they were able to use it at little cost. They recorded five pieces in between tours for Branca's debut EP Lesson No. 1.[3] &quot;The Spectacular Commodity&quot; was written before the songs on Lesson No. 1, originating as a dance piece for Branca's band the Static.[3][4]\n\nThe album's title was chosen as a continuation of works by Olivier Messiaen and John Coltrane.[5] Its iconic black-and-white cover artwork is by painter Robert Longo. It comes from Longo's &quot;Men in the Cities&quot; series, which depicts well-dressed young professionals in contorted poses.[6][7] The cover shows Branca in a suit, dragging the dead body of another man. Branca has stated that he wanted to show two men having sex; instead, he asked Longo to &quot;make an implication of this.&quot;[3]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\n\nUpon its initial release, The Ascension received positive reviews from music critics.[13] In a review for The New York Times, John Rockwell wrote that The Ascension did a better job than Lesson No. 1 of capturing the impact of Branca's live concerts but that &quot;his work may be too grand and loud ever to be captured on disk.&quot;[11] It ranked the album 6th on its list of the best albums of 1981.[14] Kristine McKenna wrote in the Los Angeles Times that the album &quot;does a surprisingly good job of conveying the awesome power of his live performanceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦[it] lacks the glorious dimension of Branca's live show, but is good enough to serve as an introduction to a major new talent.&quot;[15] The Village Voice writer Robert Christgau described the album as &quot;great sonically&quot; but continued that &quot;the beat's overstated and the sense of structureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦mired in nineteenth-century corn.&quot;[10] In the 1981 Pazz &amp; Jop list, compiled by Christgau based on a survey of several hundred critics, The Ascension placed 51st.[16]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b58fd73a1582c4d682779fc2ae132ce5bb5c52c","amp;dn":"Glenn+Branca+-+1981+-+The+Ascension+%282002+Remaster%29+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b58fd73a1582c4d682779fc2ae132ce5bb5c52c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,88,253,115,161,88,44,77,104,39,121,252,42,225,50,206,91,181,197,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
