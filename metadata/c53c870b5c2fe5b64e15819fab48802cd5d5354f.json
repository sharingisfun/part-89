Roger Miket explores the history and architecture of the settings associated with blood-curdling dramas such as the murderous goings-on at Dun Sgaith or the far-fetched yarns of Saucy Mary and Cu Chulainn. Many of the castles are shown in reconstruction and all the architectural descriptions are fully illustrated making them clear to both expert and amateur historians. Together with the earlier broachs and duns, the castles are the principal material survivals of the great pageant of Hebridean history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c53c870b5c2fe5b64e15819fab48802cd5d5354f","amp;dn":"The+Mediaeval+Castles+of+Skye+and+Lochalsh+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c53c870b5c2fe5b64e15819fab48802cd5d5354f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,60,135,11,92,47,229,182,78,21,129,159,171,72,128,44,213,213,53,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
