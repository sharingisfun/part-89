The show revolved around Dr. Nathan Bradford (Bruce Greenwood) who was the head of the team that had developed a technology to enter the dreams of psychiatric patients to discover what their true problems were. He also used the machines to enter the unconscious mind of his wife, Gail Bradford (Kathrin Nicholson) who was in a coma. The other members of the team were Kate Russell (Naomi Watts), the scholar of the group, with a vast knowledge of mythology and archetypes from many religions and Vincent Konefke (Abraham Benrubi) who was the technical guy who ran the machines but never dreamwalked himself, and Steve Turner (Michael Watson). In the first episode Ben Costigan (Jeffrey D. Sams) was introduced and he joined the team after the death of a sleepwalker. Although 9 episodes of the 12 originally ordered were shot, the series was cancelled after just 2 episodes aired. Some US and Canadian stations ran the next 5 episodes in the spring of 1998 and in Britain and Finland all 9 were shown. A number of episodes have been released on DVD (region 2) in Germany as &quot;The Sleepwalker Project&quot;.\n\nReleases\nAll nine episodes were released on VHS in Japan during the late '90s by Columbia TriStar Home Video, but were rental-only titles and could not be purchased directly.\nWarner Vision in Germany released most of the episodes on DVD as both individual PAL Region 2 titles and as box sets. The German releases feature a Dolby Digital 5.1 track in German, but the English track is the same Dolby Surround that the show was originally broadcast in.\nOn October 20, 2005 it was released by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment in Australia as a three-disc set[1] but it only features six of the episodes in random order. Each disc features two 45-minute episodes combined into one 90-minute film (Something Is Buried in Bethlehem - Night Terror, Forlorn - Counting Sheep, and Eye of The Beholder - A Matter of Fax).\nTo date, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment does not currently have any plans of releasing the show on DVD in the United States.\nMill Creek Entertainment announced the complete series on DVD.\n\nAlso known as: SonÃƒÂ¡mbulos, UnissakÃƒÂ¤velijÃƒÂ¤t, The Sleepwalker Project, Ãƒï¿½lomjÃƒÂ¡rÃƒÂ³k, ÃÅ¾Ã‘â€¦ÃÂ¾Ã‘â€šÃÂ½ÃÂ¸ÃÂºÃÂ¸ ÃÂ·ÃÂ° Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂ²ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ½ÃÂ¸Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ¼ÃÂ¸, ÃÂ§ÃÂµÃ‘â€šÃÂ²ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬Ã‘â€šÃÂ°Ã‘ï¿½ ÃÂ¼ÃÂ°Ã‘â€šÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€ ÃÂ°: ÃÅ¾ÃÂ±Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ°Ã‘â€šÃÂ½ÃÂ°Ã‘ï¿½ Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ²ÃÂ¾ÃÂ»Ã‘Å½Ã‘â€ ÃÂ¸Ã‘ï¿½.\nCountry: USA\nStudio: NBC Studios, Columbia TriStar Television\nDuration: 01:27:56 + 01:30:03 + 01:31:33\n\n\nCodec: MPEG2\nQuality: DVD\nVideo: PAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR, 25 fps, ~6123 kbps avg\nAudio #1: English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch, 48.0 KHz, 192 Kbps)  \nSubtitles #1: English\nSubtitles #2: English SDH","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:742d81839ac511af61590d6480ea54388d461fea","amp;dn":"Sleepwalkers+1997-1998+DVD+3+DISC+SET+ENG+SUB+SDH+Naomi+Watts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"742d81839ac511af61590d6480ea54388d461fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,45,129,131,154,197,17,175,97,89,13,100,128,234,84,56,141,70,31,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
