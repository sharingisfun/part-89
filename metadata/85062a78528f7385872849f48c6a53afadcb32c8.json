When she appeared on the scene in late 1991, she was one of the first mainstream divas to incorporate the sounds of house into her music. An unofficial revival of disco, house had previously thrived in the underground (...)dance scene.\n\nThe album &quot;Finally&quot; is wonderful, with several strong tracks and an introduction to CeCe's infectious personality and unforgettable rhythms. Her only mistake was moving away from her house roots on her follow-up albums, which alienated fans who were delighted and content with her role as one of the greatest dance divas of all time.\nNo way was CeCe a one hit wonder. She released other excellent singles from 1992 to 1994 like We Got A Love Thang, Inside That I Cried, I'm Not Over You, Keep On Walkin, I'm In The Mood, and the triumphant revisit to her house roots with the tracks Hit By Love (1996) and He Luvs Me 2 (2001).\n\nDon't speak ill of an artist when you don't know your music history!\n[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Ce Ce Peniston - Finally (A&amp;M 75021 5381)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Ce Ce Peniston\nAlbum................: Finally (A&amp;M 75021 5381)\nGenre................: Electronic\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1992\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 270kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
