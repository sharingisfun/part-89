Wind shear forces the crew to abort the approach just one mile from the runway. They initiate a go-around, but are directed back into a holding pattern by air traffic controllers unaware of the low-fuel situation. The Boeing 707 then runs out of fuel, causing it to crash on Long Island near New York.\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: : AVC\nVideo Bitrate: : 2,165 kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: : 1.78, (16x9)\nVideo Resolution: : 1280x720\nScan type : Progressive\nAudio Codec: : AAC LC\nAudio language: : English\nAudio Bitrate: : 160 kbps\nAudio Channels: : 2 (stereo)\nRun-Time: : 52mn\nFramerate: : 29.970 fps\nNumber of Parts: : 25\nContainer : MP4\nPart Size: : 870 MiB\nSource: : DVD\nEncoded date : 2014-07-19\nEncoded by: : Egilman ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4a0081a67e677bc3d53a9a958bab2c1335392ba","amp;dn":"Mayday.Air.Crash.Investigations.S02.E06.Missing.Over.New.York.DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4a0081a67e677bc3d53a9a958bab2c1335392ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,160,8,26,103,230,119,188,61,83,169,169,88,186,178,193,51,83,146,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
