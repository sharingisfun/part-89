Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade.\n\nEpisode info:\nCONQUERING CAPITALISM: President Obama recently proposed to end our embargo on trade and travel to Cuba. Libertarians say, &quot;This is one time Obama was right. This embargo hasn't worked. It's time to end it!&quot; But some Republicans disagree. A debate...\n\nCOMMUNISM IS &quot;COOL?&quot; People wear Che Guevara t-shirts.\nFools think Che is cool. He once said, &quot;we executed many people by firing squad without knowing if they are fully guilty.&quot; That doesn't sound like a very good role model.\n\nCAPITALISM UNDER FIRE: Critics of Capitalism like Michael Moore say, &quot;Capitalism is an evil system set up to benefit the few at the expense of the many.&quot; Nonsense. Lots of people think capitalism is immoral because it creates income inequality. But so what if some people have more than others? That's part of freedom! And that'smoral.\n\nSHOPPING IN THE USSR: For ABC, I went to Russia as a consumer reporter. The only place I found any spirit was where people risked their freedom by illegally trying to practice capitalism.\n\nDEFENDING COMMUNISM: Jesse Myerson calls himself a communist. He says the system &quot;guarantees jobs and income, the taxation of land value, [and] public options for banking,&quot; but he doesn't acknowledge all the death and starvation! I challenge him.\n\nMY TAKE: Real capitalism is good because it is voluntary. Transactions happen only when both parties are happy with them. That automatic &quot;thank you-thank you&quot; tells the truth. The relationship is fair--- not because the two parties are &quot;equal&quot; but because capitalism is voluntary, and so nothing gets sold unless each party thinks he came out ahead. The free market is voluntary. Government is force. Voluntary is better.\n\nEpisode info:\nCONQUERING CAPITALISM: President Obama recently proposed to end our embargo on trade and travel to Cuba.

Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pss on video and AAC (faac) on audio. File size limited to 350MB.
