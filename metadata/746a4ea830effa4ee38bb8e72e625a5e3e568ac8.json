Refund requested in &quot;Orders&quot; of Google Play (or Google Wallet) within 7 days is guaranteed. (may take days to manually process). REQUESTS BY EMAIL WILL BE IGNORED.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nSome of these experimental features are still in early stage. They may not work on all devices &amp; ROMs. They are included only for advanced users with sufficient knowledge about what they really mean and how to correctly use them. These features may crash your apps, or even brick your phone in the extreme cases. I will try my best to avoid those situations, but I don't take responsibility about the possible consequences. For your safety, please do a NANDroid backup before activating these features.\n\nIt is safe to purchase and install, since nothing is affected until any of the experimental features is enabled explicitly.\n\n\nXPOSED FRAMEWORK REQUIRED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:746a4ea830effa4ee38bb8e72e625a5e3e568ac8","amp;dn":"Greenify+%28Donation+Pack%29+v2.6.2+APK+%28AnDrOiD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"746a4ea830effa4ee38bb8e72e625a5e3e568ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,106,78,168,48,239,250,78,227,139,184,231,46,98,90,94,62,86,138,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
