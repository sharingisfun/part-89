Burn Your Portfolio teaches the real-world practices, professional do's and don'ts, and unwritten rules of business that most designers, photographers, web designers, copy writers, programmers, and architects only learn after putting in years of experience on the job.\n\nMichael Janda, owner of the Utah-based design firm Riser, uses humor to dispense nugget after nugget of hard-won advice collected over the last decade from the personal successes and failures he has faced running his own agency. In this surprisingly funny, but incredibly practical advice guide, Janda's advice on teamwork and collaboration, relationship building, managing clients, bidding work, production processes, and more will resonate with creative professionals of all stripes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c66a2907005c0bbb1ca60817e4ab600c1a171fd","amp;dn":"Burn+Your+Portfolio%3A+Stuff+They+Don%27t+Teach+You","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c66a2907005c0bbb1ca60817e4ab600c1a171fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,102,162,144,112,5,192,187,177,202,96,129,126,74,182,0,193,161,113,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
