Producer Don Dixon's co-production work on R.E.M.'s Murmur and Reckoning albums added attention to the record's initial release. The album today is highly regarded by most critics, and was one of Kurt Cobain's favorite albums, as noted in his journal.\n\nOne of rocks most underrated rock bands from Carteret, New Jersey, The Smithereens, released their great debut in 1986. Vocalist Pat DiNizo, guitarist Jim Babjak , drummer Dennis Diken and bassist Mike Mesaros were a bunch of 20 somethings that wanted too shake up the rock world. This album begins with the classic 60's rock sound of &quot;Strangers When We Meet&quot;, other top pop-rockers include, &quot;Groovy Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Listen To Me Girl&quot;, &quot;I Don't Want To Lose You&quot;, &quot;Crazy Mixed-Up Kid&quot; and their two big mainstream rock hits &quot;Behind The Wall Of Sleep&quot; #23 and the classic &quot;Blood And Roses&quot; #14. The band also wrote and played 3 classic ballads in, &quot;Cigarette&quot;, with some fine accordion work by Kenny Margolis and vocal work by Suzanne Vega on &quot;In A Lonely Place&quot;. \n\nWith the use of Rickenbacker guitars combined with the backing of an early REM record producer and you will find many similarities between this album which greatly influenced the sound of REM and Nirvana in the near future of this mid 1980's release.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\tTitle\t\t\t\tLength\n1.
