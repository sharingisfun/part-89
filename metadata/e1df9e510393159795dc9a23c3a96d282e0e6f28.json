Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nTonight we have JEDEDIAH BILA in place of Kennedy while she moves her family to New York\n\nTonights panel is JULIET HUDDY, SHERROD SMALL, and BRIAN MORGENSTERN. First story - Chris Christie enters the race. John Kasich's to announce bid sometime in July. More election news - Joe Biden is running. Really awful pro-hillary ad released called &quot;Chelsea's Mom&quot;. It's a parody of &quot;Stacy's Mom&quot;.\n\nOur panel returns to talk about Microagressions. The latest example is a chart of microagressions released by University of Wisconsin. Among the phrases frowned upon is &quot;You can make it in America if you work hard enough&quot;, &quot;Where are you from?&quot;, &quot;You are so articulate.&quot; and &quot;I believe the most qualified person should get the job&quot;.\n\nJUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO returns to talk about Rand Paul's recent comments about marriage in light of SCOTUS ruling. He thinks that government should get out of marriage all together. They also talk about the polygamy. Napolitano says &quot;Who cares.&quot;Afterwards they talk about a Texas AG who says that clerks can refuse gay marriage licenses based on religion.  Clerks - but not offices.\n\nTopical Storm: (WITH SHERROD SMALL!!)\nKid beats Super Mario World in 23 minutes.. blindfolded!\nDiddy falls down\nNicki Minaj forgets where she is.\nWal-Mart is cool with ISIS cakes.\nCoheed and Cambria play song written by Anthony Scalia.\nWorlds ugliest dog contest.\n\nThe panel returns to talk about Gender Neutral bathrooms. Hawaii wants to raise smoking age to 21. You can vote, you can die for your country, but you can't smoke. Electronic cigarettes included. Who would you most trust to babysit your kids? Brian says Dr. Phil. (Pft.) Juliet says John Snow of Game of Thrones fame. (He's attractive.) Sherrod says America Ferrera 'cause she'd teach his kids Spanish. (wtf. haha.) Bila wants Thor, but her kid doesn't really enter into that decision. \n\nTiny house owners TREVOR GAY and MARIANNA BENASUTTI  talk about their 224 square foot Tiny House. They save an incredible amount of money while maintaining a pretty decent standard of living.\n\nNightcap: Today is the 8th anniversary of the iPhone going on sale.\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.06.29.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 350 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 7s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 160 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 42mn 7s\nBit rate                                 : 1 022 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.150\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1022 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 42mn 7s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 38.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1df9e510393159795dc9a23c3a96d282e0e6f28","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.06.29.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1df9e510393159795dc9a23c3a96d282e0e6f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,223,158,81,3,147,21,151,149,220,154,35,195,169,109,40,46,14,111,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
