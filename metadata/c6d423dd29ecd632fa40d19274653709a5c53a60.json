This means there was no cropping so you may see small black bars around the picture's edge. This is exactly what is seen on the DVD source. The problem with cropping MST3Ks is that cropping based on the movie usually over-crops the SOL segments, sometimes a lot. Plus, automatically cropping can pull the picture out of its correct aspect ratio. So these encodes have no cropping, RF=20 constant quality video and AC3 passthru so the audio is identical to the DVD.\n\nHandbrake 0.10.1.6962 20150308\n\nVideo: AVC encode\nWidth 720, Anamorphic Loose, Copping Manual 0 0 0 0\nDeinterlace=Slower\nFPS 29.97 Constant, Preset=Very Slow, Quality RF=20.0\nAudio: AC3 Passthru 192Kbps\n\nSingle releases are RHINO\nVol01 to Vol12 are RHINO\nVol13+ are SHOUT\ntitles with subs have them set off by default\nall titles have chapters\n\nBytes.........SEp.[Title].[Volume#|Single].DVDrip.[~subs].mkv\n1,069,994,138 202.TheSidehackers.Vol03.DVDrip.mkv\n1,146,843,667 203.JungleGoddess.Vol31.DVDrip.subs.mkv\n1,113,613,434 204.CatalinaCaper.Vol01.DVDrip.mkv\n1,026,013,722 205.RocketAttackUSA.Vol27.DVDrip.mkv\n..573,289,373 206.RingOfTerror.Vol11.DVDrip.mkv\n..940,534,363 207.WildRebels.Vol09.DVDrip.mkv\n1,320,154,973 208.LostContinent.Vol18.DVDrip.mkv\n1,113,405,697 209.TheHellcats.Single.DVDrip.mkv\n1,170,561,000 210.KingDinosaur.Vol23.DVDrip.mkv\n1,384,958,709 211.FirstSpaceshipOnVenus.Vol13.DVDrip.mkv\n1,450,400,284 212.GodzillaVsMegalon.Vol10.DVDrip.mkv\n\nBig thanks to the online MST3K community for the DVD sources, some of which are out of print or hard to find.
