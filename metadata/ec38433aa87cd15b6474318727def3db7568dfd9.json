It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained.\n\nWebsite:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec38433aa87cd15b6474318727def3db7568dfd9","amp;dn":"Tor+Browser+Bundle+v+3.6.4+in+Arabic+%5BAll+OS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec38433aa87cd15b6474318727def3db7568dfd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,56,67,58,168,124,209,91,100,116,49,135,39,222,243,219,117,104,223,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
