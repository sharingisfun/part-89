Many anti-keyloggers use virtual keyboards in an attempt to circumvent keyloggers; however, screen-capturing malware \ncan obtain passwords using this method. Zemana can identify and block screen-capturing malware.\n\nZemana also has the ability to combat stealth malware that attempts to alter your system. This anti-keylogger actively monitors things such as \nrootkit installations, thread context, physical memory access, hooks, remote threads, DLL injections, kernel driver loading and system registry \nmodifications. If the software notices anything suspicious, it will ask you if the process is something you purposely want to allow access. \n\nIt can also identify purposely installed spyware or keylogger software. Keylogging or spyware software is often intentionally installed by suspicious \nloved ones or curious associates. Sometimes it is used to steal passwords, and other times to verify doubts. Zemana can discover and block this type \nof software to keep your private life private.\n\nWhile turning on your webcam may not be able to steal your passwords, it is a critical threat to block. Zemana is one of the first anti-keylogging \nsoftware to provide protection against this type of malware. Sadly, this type of threat does exist, and unsuspecting PC users Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and even children Ã¢â‚¬â€œ \nhave been monitored and spied on. We recommend that you cover the camera when it's not in use and that you use a product such as Zemana to block access. \n\nZemana can keep your private video conversations truly private.\n\nSecurity Features : 8.8/10\n\nBeyond detecting and blocking keyloggers, Zemana includes a few additional features to help you secure your privacy and manage how the software works. \nTo keep others from disabling or altering Zemana, you can password protect the software. To speed routine processes along, you can manage allow and \ndeny lists. Once a process is added to a list, the software will remember it and act automatically in subsequent occurrences. \nThe only missing tool is a virtual keyboard. Virtual keyboards are helpful if the physical keyboard has been compromised.\n\nCompatibility : 10/10\n\nSince Zemana is intended to add an additional layer of protection rather than replace antivirus software, it has been extensively tested for \ncompatibility with popular security software. Unlike most software vendors that claim their software is compatible with most security software, \nZemana actually publishes a list of the software it has tested AntiLogger with. Zemana has been tested while running with nearly 50 security products \nand has been proven to successfully work with Trend Micro, Webroot, Kaspersky, ESET, AVG, Bitdefender, F-Secure and Avast. Compatibility tests were \nrun using Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8, both the 32- and 64-bit versions. AntiLogger is even compatible with the keystroke encryption software KeyScrambler. \nAntiLogger only requires 50MB of disk space and 256MB of memory to run.\n\nZemana AntiLogger Summary : 9.3/10\n\nZemana can successfully block financial malware, in-the-wild keyloggers, installed keylogger software and hardware access. \nIt works with most major security products and runs on all Windows-based operating systems, including 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and 8. \n\nThis anti-keylogger software is at the top of its game and is one of the best keylogger protection applications on the market.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/fr/file/852981a98e31d16d28363a2199c65ade1477eb5091eb6d96e49ab315af5492f0/analysis/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.virustotal.com/fr/file/852981a98e31d16d28363a2199c65ade1477eb5091eb6d96e49ab315af5492f0/analysis/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc70888e6a85b45127bcc3c152b690fc0d98646a","amp;dn":"Zemana+AntiLogger+v.1.9.3.602+incl.+2+years+activ.+by+DeGun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc70888e6a85b45127bcc3c152b690fc0d98646a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,112,136,142,106,133,180,81,39,188,195,193,82,182,144,252,13,152,100,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
