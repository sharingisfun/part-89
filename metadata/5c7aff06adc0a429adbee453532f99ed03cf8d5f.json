Between running events and fundraisers and offering free food and care packages during finals week, Arlene is so special to one campus fraternity that they've nominated her diner for the show. They round up the town to help Ty Pennington and Amanda Freitag pull off a one-of-a-kind makeover for this one-of-a-kind diner.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 26-Jun-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7aff06adc0a429adbee453532f99ed03cf8d5f","amp;dn":"American.Diner.Revival.S01E06.Fraternity.Fix-Up.PDTV.x264-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7aff06adc0a429adbee453532f99ed03cf8d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,122,255,6,173,192,164,41,173,190,228,83,83,47,153,237,3,207,141,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
