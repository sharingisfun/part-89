Music helps intensify and brighten images and action that take place upon the screen. Many times purchasing the soundtrack turns into a disappointment because no connection was made between the music on the soundtrack and the movie. That is definitely not the case with Mark Knopfler's musical score for &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. Knopfler, as a composer, has an incredible knack of capturing images in his music.\n\nThe music in the movie is barely noticeable. It doesn't detract from the movie at all. You won't notice how much of an impact that it does have until you hear the music on its own without the movie playing over it. If you have seen the movie only once, the songs on this soundtrack will conjure the images from the movie. You can almost hear Fezzik and Inigo exchanging rhymes on &quot;The Friend's Song&quot;, and the daring climb on &quot;The Cliffs of Insanity&quot;.\n\nAs you listen to the soundtrack, you'll be seeing the movie in your mind. There are few soundtracks that are so intertwined with the movie that they can elicit such imagery. Knopfler is able to pull off that feat. If you liked the movie, the soundtrack is definitely worth it.[/quote]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Mark Knopfler - The Princess Bride (Warner 25610)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Mark Knopfler\nAlbum................: The Princess Bride (Warner 25610)\nGenre................: Soundtrack\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1987\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 45 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
