The title alludes to the way in which she compartmentalises these relationships and stages of her life.\n\nStarring: Jane Birkin, Geraldine Chaplin, Michel Piccoli, Natacha RÃƒÂ©gnier, Lou Doillon, John Hurt, Maurice BÃƒÂ©nichou, TchÃƒÂ©ky Karyo, AdÃƒÂ¨le Exarchopoulos, Annie Girardot\ns.a. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0901473/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0901473/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxes_%28film%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxes_%28film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe audio track is the original mix of English and French dialogues. There are two subtitle tracks, English (srt) with the translations of the French dialogues and French (srt) with the translations of the English dialogues. Both where ripped from the DVD, OCRed into srt-files and muxed back into the MKV container file. The English text was checked carefully and should be ok. The French translation of the English dialogues was done by machine-ocr only. Therefore I included the resulting srt-file and the original sub-file. Maybe some francophile could improve the srt and post it back at\n\nThe Making-of extras are like the originals French only without subtitles. \nThe trailer has hardcoded French subtitles for the English dialogues.\n\nDon't be fooled by the seemingly low bit rate.  If you use the correct Codec/LAV Filter for x265/HEVC you will get the quality just as on the DVD. It's just the best there is and it workes great for me with VLC-player as well as ZoomPlayer.\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding\n\nFormat: MKV (Matroska) 692 MiB, 1h 40mn\nOverall bit rate: 967 Kbps\nWriting application: mkvmerge v8.1.0 ('Psychedelic Postcard') 64bit\nWriting library: Lavf55.12.0 \nCodec ID: V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding, x265 1.4)\n660 x 576 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio 16:10 (=Original)\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps (Constant)\n\nAudio: AAC 2 channels 48.0 KHz\n\nText #1 (Default, English)\nUTF-8: engl. text f. french audio parts\n\nText #2 (Optional, French)\nUTF-8: french. text f. engl. audio parts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d071ee28f4421448701f9f6b291accde66ecd6fa","amp;dn":"Boxes+-+Les+boites+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d071ee28f4421448701f9f6b291accde66ecd6fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,113,238,40,244,66,20,72,112,31,159,107,41,26,204,222,102,236,214,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
