The book is an introduction to algorithmic complexity. Examples taken from current research in the polymer sciences are used for compression of like-natured properties as found on a chain of polymers. Both theory and applied aspects of algorithmic compression are reviewed. A description of the types of polymers and their uses is followed by a chapter on various types of compression systems that can be used to compress polymer chains into manageable units. The work is intended for graduate and postgraduate university students in the physical sciences and engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b652bc076646ecdec1720f900447b718437befba","amp;dn":"Algorithmic+Techniques+for+the+Polymer+Sciences","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b652bc076646ecdec1720f900447b718437befba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,82,188,7,102,70,236,222,193,114,15,144,4,71,183,24,67,123,239,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
