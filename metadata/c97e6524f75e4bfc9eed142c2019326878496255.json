Pete Seeger was an American folk singer and a fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940's, he also had a string of hits during the 1950's as a member of The Weavers. In the 1960's, he re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights, counterculture and environmental causes.\n\nAs a song writer, he is best known as the author or co-author of &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?, &quot;If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)&quot;, and &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn!&quot;, which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement. Seeger was one of the folksingers most responsible for popularizing the spiritual &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; that became the anthem of the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement. 'Rainbow Race' was released in 1971 and continues with songs of protest and reflections from 'Last Train to Nuremberg' drawing a direct line between Nazi war crimes and the My Lai massacre in Vietnam to the title track where he declares that he will fight on: &quot;And because I love you,&quot; goes the chorus of the latter, sung with a choir of children, &quot;I'll give it one more try/To show my rainbow race/It's too soon to die&quot;.\n\n\n01 - Last Train To Nuremberg\n02 - Sailing Down This Golden River\n03 - Uncle Ho\n04 - Snow Snow\n05 - My Rainbow Race\n06 - Our Generation\n07 - Old Devil Time\n08 - The Clearwater\n09 - Words Words Words\n10 - Hobo's Lullaby\n\n*Talking Elephant 2014\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c97e6524f75e4bfc9eed142c2019326878496255","amp;dn":"Pete+Seeger+-+Rainbow+Race+%281971%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c97e6524f75e4bfc9eed142c2019326878496255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,126,101,36,247,94,75,252,158,237,20,44,32,25,50,104,120,73,98,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
