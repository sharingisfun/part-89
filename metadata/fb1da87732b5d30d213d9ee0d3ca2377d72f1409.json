The man, Emillio, uses a potion \n\nwhich apparently saves Ryouma's life. However, he is also changed into a girl in the \n\nprocess. Emillio is actually the prince of this alternate world and he declares \n\nRyouma as his wife, presumably on the context of saving his life. But what about\n\nRyouma's life as a high school boy in his own world? And will he come to accept \n\nbeing the prince's wife?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1da87732b5d30d213d9ee0d3ca2377d72f1409","amp;dn":"Sekainohate+De+Aimashou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1da87732b5d30d213d9ee0d3ca2377d72f1409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,29,168,119,50,181,211,13,33,61,158,224,211,202,35,119,215,47,20,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
