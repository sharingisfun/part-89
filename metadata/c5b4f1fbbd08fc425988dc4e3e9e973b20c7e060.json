SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s settling into her new role as the Countess of Goldengreen; sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually dating again; sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s even agreed to take on Quentin as her official squire. Life is looking up all around - and that inevitably means itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for things to take a turn for the worse.\n\nSomeone has kidnapped the sons of Duchess Dianda Lorden, regent of the Undersea Duchy of Saltmist. To prevent a war between land and sea, Toby must not only find the missing boys, but also prove that the Queen of the Mists was not behind their abduction. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need all her tricks and the help of all her allies if she wants to make it through this in one piece.\n\nTobyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search will take her from the streets of San Francisco to the lands beneath the waves, and her deadline is firm: she must find the boys in three daysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ time, or all of the Mists will pay the price. But someone is determined to stop her - and whoever it is isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t playing by OberonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Laws....\n\nAs the battle grows more and more personal, one thing is chillingly clear. When Faerie goes to war, not everyone will walk away","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b4f1fbbd08fc425988dc4e3e9e973b20c7e060","amp;dn":"One+Salt+Sea+-+Seanan+McGuire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b4f1fbbd08fc425988dc4e3e9e973b20c7e060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,180,241,251,189,8,252,66,89,136,220,78,62,158,151,59,32,199,224,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
