Focuses on basic issues, relating theory to practice wherever possible. Numerous examples, worked out in detail, have been included to help the reader develop an intuitive grasp of the theory. Topics covered include the sampling process, digital modulation techniques, error-control coding, robust quantization for pulse-code modulation, coding speech at low bit radio, information theoretic concepts, coding and computer communication. Because the book covers a broad range of topics in digital communications, it should satisfy a variety of backgrounds and interests","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf0ced718e5af6a7bfa34280c9a9bb475cccfc1","amp;dn":"Digital+Communication+Systems+%5B2013%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf0ced718e5af6a7bfa34280c9a9bb475cccfc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,240,206,215,24,229,175,106,123,250,52,40,12,154,155,180,117,204,207,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
