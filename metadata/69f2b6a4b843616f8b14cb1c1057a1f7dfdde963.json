Mudhoney were the first real success story for Sub Pop Records; their indie-scene success laid the groundwork for the movement that would (briefly) make Seattle, Washington, the new capital of the rock &amp; roll universe; and they took the sweat-soaked and beer-fueled mixture of heavy metal muscle, punk attitude, and garage rock primitivism that would become known as &quot;grunge&quot; to the hipster audience for the first time, who would in turn sell it to a mass audience ready for something new. Though Mudhoney never scored the big payday some of their old-running buddies did, their importance on the Seattle scene cannot be underestimated, and their body of work -- big, loud, purposefully sloppy, a little bit menacing, and even more funny -- has stood the test of time better than their well-known colleagues. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Sub Pop\nIncluded.............: Covers, Lossless Audio Checker, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n01.In 'N' Out Of Grace\n02.Suck You Dry\n03.I Have To Laugh\n04.Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More\n05.Who You Drivin' Now\n06.You Got It\n07.Judgement, Rage, Retribution And Thyme\n08.Into The Drink\n09.A Thousand Forms Of Mind\n10.Generation Genocide\n11.If I Think\n12.Here Comes Sickness\n13.Let It Slide\n14.Touch Me I'm Sick\n15.This Gift\n16.Good Enough\n17.Blinding Sun\n18.Into Your Shtik\n19.Beneath The Valley Of The Underdog\n20.When Tomorrow Hits\n21.Make It Now Again\n22.Hate The Police\n\nCD2\n\n01.Hey Sailor\n02.Twenty Four\n03.Baby Help Me Forget\n04.Revolution\n05.You Stupid Asshole\n06.Who Is Who\n07.Stab Your Back\n08.Pump It Up\n09.The Money Will Roll Right In\n10.Fix Me\n11.Dehumanized\n12.She's Just 15\n13.Baby O Baby\n14.Over The Top\n15.You Give Me The Creeps\n16.March To Fuzz\n17.Ounce Of Deception\n18.Paperback Life\n19.Bushpusher Man\n20.Fuzzbeater\n21.Overblown\n22.Run Shithead Run\n23.King Sandbox\n24.Tonight I Think I'm Gonna Go Downtown\n25.Holden\n26.Not Going Down That Road Again\n27.Brand New Face\n28.Drinking For Two\n29.Butterfly Stroke\n30.Editions Of You\n\n\n\nSupersuckers\nHow The Supersuckers Became The Greatest Rock And Roll Band In The World (1999)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nSomething of an anomaly on the Sub Pop roster, the Supersuckers bore a limited surface resemblance to grunge, but they were a party band at heart, donning cowboy hats and kicking out a gleefully trashy brand of throttling, rockabilly-flavored garage punk. Their lyrics were a raucous, over-the-top celebration of all the attendant evils of rock &amp; roll -- sex, booze, drugs, Satan, and whatever other vices the band could think of, all glorified with tongue planted firmly in cheek. Save for an abrupt and temporary detour into hardcore honky tonk, their approach stayed relatively consistent through the '90s, as did their quality control. \n\n\nGenre................: Alternative Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Sub Pop\nIncluded.............: Covers, Lossless Audio Checker, Log\n\n\n01.Coattail Rider\n02.Creepy Jackaloope Eye\n03.Born With A Tail\n04.Luck\n05.On The Couch\n06.Doublewide\n07.Hot Rod Rally\n08.She's My Bitch\n09.Bad, Bad, Bad\n10.Dead In The Water\n11.How To Maximize Your Kill Count\n12.Ron's Got The Cocaine\n13.Roadworn And WearY\n14.Supersucker Drive-By Blues\n15.Givin' It Away\n16.All Right\n17.Saddletramp\n18.Can't Resist\n19.Dead Homiez\n20.Psyched Out\n21.Hell City, Hell\n22.Before They Make Me Run\n23.Bloody Mary Morning\n24.Wake Me When It's Over\n25.Good Livin'\n26.Monkey\n27.Beat To Shit\n\n\n\nThe Reverend Horton Heat\nHoly Roller (1999)\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nThe Reverend Horton Heat is perhaps the most popular psychobilly artist of all time, really rivaled only by genre founders the Cramps. The Reverend (as both the three-man band and its guitar-playing frontman were known) built a strong cult following during the '90s through constant touring, manic showmanship, and a twisted sense of humor. The latter was nothing new in the world of psychobilly, and Heat's music certainly kept the trashy aesthetic of his spiritual forebears. The Reverend's true innovation was updating the psychobilly sound for the alternative rock era. In his hands, it was something more than retro-obsessed kitsch -- it had roaring distorted guitars, it rocked as hard as any punk band, and it didn't look exclusively to pop culture of the past for its style or subject matter. Most of The Reverend's lyrics were gonzo celebrations of sex, drugs, booze, and cars, and true to his name, his concerts often featured mock sermons in the style of a rural revivalist preacher. First performing as The Reverend Horton Heat in 1985, his backing band solidified around 1989 with bassist Jimbo Wallace and drummer Patrick &quot;Taz&quot; Bentley. Their initial recordings were released by that bastion of indie credibility, Sub Pop, at the height of the grunge craze; both 1991's Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em and 1993's The Full Custom Gospel Sounds of the Reverend Horton Heat helped build an enthusiastic underground audience. That resulted in a spell on major label Interscope, starting with 1994's Liquor in the Front (Bentley was subsequently replaced by Scott Churilla). After two more for Interscope, 1996's It's Martini Time and 1998's Space Heater, Heat returned to recording for independents, still a highly profitable draw on the concert circuit. \n\nGenre................: Psychobilly\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Sub Pop\nIncluded.............: Covers, Lossless Audio Checker, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.Big Sky\n02.Baddest Of The Bad\n03.Wiggle Stick\n04.Big Red Rocket Of Love\n05.Bales Of Cocaine\n06.Bath-Water Blues\n07.Lie Detector\n08.400 Bucks\n09.Marijuana\n10.It's Martini Time\n11.Baby I'm Drunk\n12.Where In The Hell Did You Go With My Toothbrush\n13.Bad Reputation\n14.One Time For Me\n15.Now, Right Now\n16.Slow\n17.Love Whip\n18.Jimbo Song\n19.Big Little Baby\n20.Cowboy Love\n21.In Your Wildest Dreams\n22.Eat Steak\n23.Folsom Prison Blues\n24.The Entertainer\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69f2b6a4b843616f8b14cb1c1057a1f7dfdde963","amp;dn":"Reverend+Horton+Heat.Mudhoney.Supersuckers+Best+Of%27s+%7BFLAC%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69f2b6a4b843616f8b14cb1c1057a1f7dfdde963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,242,182,164,184,67,97,111,139,20,203,28,16,87,161,247,223,221,233,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
