In the dying days of World War 2, The US Army is running Operation Paperclip - getting the makers of the V2 out of Germany and into America before the Russians overrun their position.\n\nThis is where history takes a hard turn. They arrive to find the Germans and all their machinery gone - taken by the British. MINISTRY OF SPACE provides an alternative history painted in red, white and blue! In the death throes of the Second World War, the British capture the cream of Nazi rocket science and create a new British Empire where it seems the sun never sets!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd59713aaac8ef0308cf718863b0d288aa24dbf1","amp;dn":"Ministry_of_Space_%282006%2C_2nd_print%29_%28Digital%29_%28Zone-Empire%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd59713aaac8ef0308cf718863b0d288aa24dbf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,89,113,58,170,200,239,3,8,207,113,136,99,176,210,136,170,36,219,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
