These images create mood, evoke emotion, and pique our curiosity. They have that certain something that other portraits seem to lack. These rare images are memorableÃ¢â‚¬â€the kind of shots that clients want and photographers strive to emulate. These portraits are technically precise and have style.\n\nNeil van Niekerk is a big name in the portrait and wedding photography industry. His masterful photographs get a reaction, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s devoted to helping others create compelling portraits for their clients. In this book, van Niekerk shows readers strategies for creating a wide range of portrait looks (romantic, fun, sweet, dramatic, glamorous, or moody) in lackluster, middle-of-nowhere locales, small home studios, big expanses, and even on rooftops. Starting with traditional lighting and posing strategies and moving through Ã¢â‚¬Å“spicierÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ varieties, he shows readers how integrating specialized lighting (rim lighting, backlighting, flare, and low-key lightingÃ¢â‚¬â€using natural light and artificial sources) and compositional approaches (shallow depth of field, lens compression, and unorthodox perspectives) into their creative approach can allow them to take full creative control over their portrait-taking process so that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re able to deliver incredible shots of their clients in any photographic conditions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c78e5f404902de79a7a3e97443db02538402765","amp;dn":"Lighting+%26amp%3B+Design+For+Portrait+Photography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c78e5f404902de79a7a3e97443db02538402765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,120,229,244,4,144,45,231,154,122,62,151,68,61,176,37,56,64,39,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
