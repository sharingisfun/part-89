Gwen Stefani is the second song off the Southpaw soundtrack after &quot;Phenomenal.&quot; Here Em utilizes the same rapping style he uses on &quot;Phenomenal,&quot; and most of MMLP2 for that matter: forward-leaning, dextrous, monotone yet emotional.\n\nShowing up to deliver just a few lines on the chorus, Gwen Stefani plays a small role but delivers a strong vocal performance, booned by the fact that her voice is more compatible with this guitar-heavy beat than Eminem's. Though it's sometimes to hard to listen to these new Eminem records with his '90s-early-'00s virtuosity in the back of your mind, you already know &quot;Kings Never Die&quot; is gonna sound dope in theaters for the movie.\n\nThe Southpaw soundtrack is out July 24, check the tracklist here.\n\n\nAcabou de ser lanÃƒÂ§ada a nova mÃƒÂºsica do Eminem Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kings Never DieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, que faz parte da trilha sonora de Ã¢â‚¬Å“SouthpawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ e conta com a participaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o da Gwen Stefani. 50 Cent, Tech N9ne entre outros artistas terÃƒÂ£o mÃƒÂºsicas na trilha sonora tambÃƒÂ©m.
