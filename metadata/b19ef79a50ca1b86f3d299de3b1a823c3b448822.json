It's about herd immunization, the mass drugging of our population, and the industrialized production of cheap, storable food. We've ended up with an entire society getting sicker and sicker while the industrial powers get richer and richer. What were once considered farfetched conspiracy theories are now being shown to be stark irrefutable realities. Serious illnesses have been on a steep incline since the number of mandated vaccines has skyrocketed (starting with infants within their first hours of life) coupled with the advent of GMO foods since the mid 1990's. But if anyone dares question these remarkable correlations then they are labeled anti-science and ignorant. We used to brag that we had the most remarkable healthcare system in the world, the last example of a great private healthcare system. Now we are waking up to the fact that we don't have a private system, we have a pharmaceuticalized system and it has created the sickest species ever to inhabit this earth...our children. Your food, your health, your family's health has been Bought.\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Bought.(2015).WEBRip.1080p.x264-[f1d].MP4\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 3.08 GiB\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 4 757 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2015-01-14 03:10:44\nTagged date : UTC 2015-01-14 03:10:44\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : High@L4\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nBit rate : 4 497 Kbps\nWidth : 1 920 pixels\nHeight : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.072\nStream size : 2.91 GiB (95%)\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r11 24e4fed\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x113 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=72 / lookahead_threads=8 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / stitchable=1 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=infinite / keyint_min=29 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=crf / mbtree=1 / crf=20.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=5 / qpmax=69 / qpstep=4 / vbv_maxrate=4950 / vbv_bufsize=13500 / crf_max=0.0 / nal_hrd=none / filler=0 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\nEncoded date : UTC 2015-01-14 03:10:44\nTagged date : UTC 2015-01-14 03:10:44\nColor range : Limited\nColor primaries : BT.709\nTransfer characteristics : BT.709\nMatrix coefficients : BT.709\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 1h 32mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 170 MiB (5%)\nEncoded date : UTC 2015-01-14 03:10:44\nTagged date : UTC 2015-01-14 03:10:44","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b19ef79a50ca1b86f3d299de3b1a823c3b448822","amp;dn":"Bought+%282015%29+WEBRip+1080p+x264-%5Bf1d%5D+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b19ef79a50ca1b86f3d299de3b1a823c3b448822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,158,247,154,80,202,27,134,243,210,153,222,59,26,130,60,59,68,136,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
