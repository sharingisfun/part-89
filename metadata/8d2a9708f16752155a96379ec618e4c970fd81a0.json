Over 300 pieces are illustrated, generally one to a page, with 50-150 words of text written by Gallery staff. The organization is by period or school (German painting, French painting of the later XIX century, etc.), and each section has a one-page general introduction. Not quite laid out to be a gallery guide--no maps or plans are given--this still serves as a very good introduction to the major works. The illustrations, small as required by the series format, are good. Other larger, more extensive books exist on the Gallery's collections, but this is excellent value","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d2a9708f16752155a96379ec618e4c970fd81a0","amp;dn":"National+Gallery+of+Art%2C+Washington+%28Thames+and+Hudson+1992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d2a9708f16752155a96379ec618e4c970fd81a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,42,151,8,241,103,82,21,90,150,55,158,198,24,228,201,112,253,129,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
