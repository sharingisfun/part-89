She didn't plan to respect his last will, which was to run the farm, but loses her job and is forced to accept hosting a new 'green' program. In order to keep it, she must pay off a $75,000 mortgage. To that end, she hopes to win the pumpkin growing contest using grandpa's winning seed line and cultivation log. Neighbor Seth Cullen, the town's handyman (and actually a Stanford engineering graduate), has a hard time convincing her they need to team up.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1526745&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1526745&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNote:\n\nHad a hard time finding this movie.
