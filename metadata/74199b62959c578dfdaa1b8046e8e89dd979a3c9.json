The Class 105 could also found on suburban routes out of London KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cross before electrification. \n\nOnce the stable of North East railways, operating alongside their superior cousins, the Class 101, most of the units that operated in that area were based at the DMU Maintenance Depot at Bank Top, Darlington. However, some units were based at Heaton Depot, Newcastle and operated local services to Sunderland, Hartlepool and Durham. \n\nSome Cravens Class 105s were designated as Class 106s, due to them being fitted with different engines; however they were all later re-classified to Class 105. They were also based on the BR Mk1 coach body, underframe and bogies, Cravens having built a number of these coaches for British Rail previously. \n\nNineteen of the Class ran as three car units, but all of the centre cars had been withdrawn and re-used in Class 101 trains by 1970. None of the units were selected for refurbishment as they were candidates for early withdrawal, however they operated in passenger service until 1988 in their BR Corporate Blue livery. \n\nThe Class has also fared badly in preservation, with only three vehicles preserved today; a number of cars were also purchased and sectioned for use as store rooms on North Sea gas platforms, although it is not known whether any of these sections survived. \n\nThe Class 105 for Train Simulator is available in British Railways Green livery and features a working gear lever, wipers, engine start/stop, AWS, headlamps and tail markers, and changeable numberboards. \n\n\n\n\nNOTE THIS ONLY WORKS WITH THE PIRATED VERSION OF TRAINS SIMULATOR 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74199b62959c578dfdaa1b8046e8e89dd979a3c9","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+BR+Class+105+DMU+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74199b62959c578dfdaa1b8046e8e89dd979a3c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,25,155,98,149,156,87,141,253,170,27,128,70,232,232,157,217,121,163,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
