The show follows a smart-mouthed dog who is incredibly obese, so much to the point that he is ball shaped with small, stubby legs. Other characters include Little Costumed Buddy, Piranha Mae, and Onion Boy. The group try to fight crime in the fictional neighbourhood &quot;Neighbourhood X&quot; and they try to search for justice but often fail humorously. The series was aired from 1998 to 2001. It aired again on Cartoon Network UK until 2005","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0896a34b6f79870ebfcab243afc94b9fb6f0b4b","amp;dn":"Fat+Dog+Mendoza+Cartoon+in+English+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0896a34b6f79870ebfcab243afc94b9fb6f0b4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,137,106,52,182,247,152,112,235,252,171,36,58,252,148,185,251,111,11,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
