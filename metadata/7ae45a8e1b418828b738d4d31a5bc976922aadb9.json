EdgarÃ‚â€™s obsession with Gay and voyeuristic sex and its links to the priorities of his law enforcement agency. ItÃ‚â€™s the most detailed and most shocking insight into J. Edgar Hoover ever published, an unprecedented overview of a life devoted to unveiling other peopleÃ‚â€™s darkest secrets while rigorously concealing his own. Award-winning celebrity biographer Darwin Porter answers the questions youÃ‚â€™ve always wanted to know. But if youÃ‚â€™d asked them during HooverÃ‚â€™s heyday, heÃ‚â€™d probably have had you investigated and punished. He loved to pal around with celebrities, and thrived on gossip (Ty Power was into scat, etc). This is a fun read.\nHow J. Edgar orchestrated relentless searches for celebrities he claimed were Ã‚â€œas red as their underwear,Ã‚â€ probing deep into the lives of Americans as diverse as Marlene Dietrich, Errol Flynn, Albert Einstein, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Marlon Brando, and Jane FondaÃ‚â€”and what he found. In the 1940s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt told his trusted but promiscuous (gay) aide, Sumner Welles, Ã‚â€œHooverÃ‚â€™s caught all of us with our pants down. but someday, someone is going to catch him jaybird naked and involved in the most lustful, perverted behavior.Ã‚â€ With the publication of Darwin PorterÃ‚â€™s newest book, that long-awaited day has come at last. \n\n\n&quot;This book contains the most degrading revelations I have come across in\nmore than 30 years of research.\nThe author turns over every disgusting slime-covered stone and unearths\na cornucopia of degradation and corruption more filthy to the imagination\nthan even Larry Flynt could conjure.\nPorter reveals the most repellent, most vile and most intrepid research that I've\never encountered.\nI cannot recommend this book highly enough.\nNow, please excuse me while I go and take a steaming hot shower... &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae45a8e1b418828b738d4d31a5bc976922aadb9","amp;dn":"J.+Edgar+Hoover+and+Clyde+Tolson+by+Darwin+Porter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae45a8e1b418828b738d4d31a5bc976922aadb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,228,90,142,27,65,136,40,183,56,212,211,26,91,201,118,146,42,173,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
