The album was designed by songwriter and singer Andrew Eldritch as an attack on the policies of the George H. W. Bush administration. Described by Andrew Eldritch as 'a fine album', it was included by Q magazine in their 'Fifty Best Albums of 1990' list. It appears the majority of tracks on the album are based on the original demos, Eldritch being unhappy with the mixed versions and going back to basics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0525b1ddcb4bd5daef2a962ecc266a6b679b8265","amp;dn":"THE+SISTERS+OF+MERCY+-+Vision+Thing+%281990%29+%5BGothic+Rock%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0525b1ddcb4bd5daef2a962ecc266a6b679b8265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,37,177,221,203,75,213,218,239,42,150,46,204,38,106,107,103,155,130,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
