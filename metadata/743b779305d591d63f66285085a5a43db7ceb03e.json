The human race had launched a new space shuttle to explore the galaxy, and despite its success of discovering new life forms and planets, a mysterious life form breached the shuttle and directed the ship toward Earth. With Earth now at risk of war and invasion, Shark Attack has been sent to deal with this threat.\n\nThe game features six levels, each with a boss fight. A training mode is available as well. The directional arrows are pressed to move the character around the scrolling enviorment while the Z key is pressed to fire (held to auto-fire). There are three diffuculties to choose from, each featuring a different character.\nThe game features a unique power-up and special attack system. The special attack, known as Focus Mode, positions the player precisely to dodge oncoming bullets and aim at enemies, while simultaneously slowing them down.\n\nWhen the player shoots a certain enemy, a power-up capsule will fall out, and touching it will make the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard weapon powerful for a period of time and increase the score multiplier. Collecting more power-up capsules will make the player more powerful for a longer period of time and increases the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multiplier. Whenever a life is lost, the power-ups are lost and must be recollected","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:743b779305d591d63f66285085a5a43db7ceb03e","amp;dn":"Shark+Attack+by+PSURG+design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"743b779305d591d63f66285085a5a43db7ceb03e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,59,119,147,5,213,145,214,63,102,40,80,133,165,164,61,183,206,176,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
