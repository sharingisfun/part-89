It is also the first part created for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles and PCs. Therefore, developers from Codemasters studio (creator of series such as DiRT, Race Driver, Colin McRae Rally, Micro Machines, etc.) had to think of a completely new technology driving the game, and change the publishing time framework, as earlier parts appeared at the end of each year. F1 2015 was released at the start of Formula 1 season and was constantly updated based on the events unfolding on real tracks. This means that the driversÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ parameters and the performance of individual teamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ cars were influenced by their real-life equivalents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d9c2a4ab7aef4bf802a21c5ad78951e5c37f388","amp;dn":"F.1.2015.New.Released.PC.Game-R.G.Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d9c2a4ab7aef4bf802a21c5ad78951e5c37f388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,156,42,74,183,174,244,191,128,42,33,197,173,120,149,30,92,55,243,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
