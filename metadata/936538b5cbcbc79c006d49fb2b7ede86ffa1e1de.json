Wreck has grown up, and on his eighteenth birthday, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be cast out out of the orphanage. And WreckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems aren't merely about finding a home. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been quietly breaking the cardinal rule of any good drug dealer and dipping into his own supply of the sap he sells. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also pretty sure heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being haunted by the ghost of a kid he used to knowÃ¢â‚¬â€Zeke Wilkes, who almost certainly died six months ago. Zeke would have every reason to pester Wreck, since Wreck got him inside the walled city of Seattle in the first place, and that was probably what killed him.Maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only a guilty conscience, but Wreck canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take it anymore, so he sneaks over the wall.\n\nThe walled-off wasteland of Seattle is every bit as bad as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d heard, chock-full of the hungry un-dead and utterly choked by the poisonous, inescapable yellow gas. And then there's the monster. Rector's pretty certain that whatever attacked him was not at all humanÃ¢â‚¬â€and not a rotter, either. Arms far too long. Posture all strange. Eyes all wild and faintly glowing gold and known to the locals as simply &quot;&quot;The Inexplicables.&quot;&quot;\n\nIn the process of tracking down these creatures, Rector comes across another incursion through the wallÃ¢â‚¬â€just as bizarre but entirely attributable to human greed. It seems some outsiders have decided there's gold to be found in the city and they're willing to do whatever it takes to get a piece of the pie unless Rector and his posse have anything to do with it.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 256 Kbps\nUnabridged\nApproximate Running Time: 6 Hours\nNumber of CDs: 6\nISBN # 978-1-62851-102-4\nContent Rating: Ages 13+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936538b5cbcbc79c006d49fb2b7ede86ffa1e1de","amp;dn":"Cherie+Priest+-++The+Inexplicables+%28The+Clockwork+Century+%234%29+%5BG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936538b5cbcbc79c006d49fb2b7ede86ffa1e1de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,101,56,181,203,203,199,156,0,109,73,251,43,126,222,134,255,161,225,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
