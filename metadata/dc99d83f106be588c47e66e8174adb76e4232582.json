Its sound is quite like Souvlaki's -- swelling waves of flanged guitars, layers of wispy vocals floating in and out of the mix, and sweet lazy pop songs -- but the production sometimes turns the band's plush, sweet sound into the sort of cheap and cheesy pleasantness one might expect from a new age artist. A few tracks hint at the sound that would be fully achieved on Souvlaki (&quot;Celia's Dream,&quot; &quot;Erik's Song&quot;), and the album as a whole must have sounded wonderful before anyone knew what great things the band was capable of -- but Just for a Day is really Slowdive in their infancy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc99d83f106be588c47e66e8174adb76e4232582","amp;dn":"Slowdive+-+1991+-+Just+for+a+Day+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc99d83f106be588c47e66e8174adb76e4232582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,153,216,63,16,107,229,136,196,126,102,232,23,74,219,118,228,35,37,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
