It was released in 2004, soon after the announcement that the band had broken up, and that lead singer Scott Stapp and the other members of the band would go their separate ways (although the band has since reunited). It consists of every one of their U.S. singles, and only leaves out their international single, &quot;Hide&quot;. The album also includes a DVD that contains all of the band's music videos and several live performances.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. &quot;My Own Prison&quot;\n02. &quot;What's This Life For&quot;\n03. &quot;Higher&quot;\n04. &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;\n05. &quot;What If&quot;\n06. &quot;One Last Breath&quot;\n07. &quot;Don't Stop Dancing&quot;\n08. &quot;Bullets&quot; (animated)\n09. &quot;My Sacrifice&quot;\n10. &quot;Torn&quot; (Live)\n11. &quot;Higher&quot; (Live)\n12. &quot;Weathered&quot; (Live)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893697e68049151cc0fbe31e0bbe0ab8effb7606","amp;dn":"Creed+%26ndash%3B+Greatest+Hits+-+2004+%28DVD5%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893697e68049151cc0fbe31e0bbe0ab8effb7606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,54,151,230,128,73,21,28,192,251,227,30,11,190,10,184,239,251,118,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
