In addition to exploring such engaging topics as dark energy, parallel universes, the Doppler effect, the God particle, and Maxwell's demon, the book's timeline extends back billions of years to the hypothetical Big Bang and forward trillions of years to a time of Ã¢â‚¬Å“quantum resurrection.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Like the previous titles in this series, The Physics Book helps readers gain an understanding of major concepts without getting bogged down in complex details.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nClifford A.
