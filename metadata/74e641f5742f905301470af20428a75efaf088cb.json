It goes from play-to-play-to-play. Making each game about 45 minutes long or so.\n\nMost of these games are HDTV rips, and a few are WEBrips from NFL Game Rewind.\n\nAll games are in either 1080p or 720.    \n    \nEnjoy! And look for some other releases, as I plan on doing the entire NFC North!    \n\n================================================\n================================================\n\n\nAny questions, comments or concerns, contact me on Reddit: DairylandDan\n\nGO PACK and GO NFC NORTH","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e641f5742f905301470af20428a75efaf088cb","amp;dn":"Green+Bay+Packers+2014+Complete+Season+%28Condensed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e641f5742f905301470af20428a75efaf088cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,230,65,245,116,47,144,83,1,71,10,242,4,40,167,94,250,240,136,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
