Conceived as a companion volume to the earlier works, Materials Processing during Casting (2006) and Physics of Functional Materials (2008), this book analyzes solidification and crystallization processes in depth.\n\nStarting from the thermodynamic point of view, it gives a complete description, taking into account kinetics and mass transfer, down to the final structure. Importantly, the book shows the relationship between the theory and the experimental results. Topics covered include:\n\nFundamentals of thermodynamics\nProperties of interfaces\nNucleation\nCrystal growth - in vapours, liquids and melts\nHeat transport during solidification processes\nSolidification structures - faceted, dendritic, eutectic and peritectic\nMetallic glasses and amorphous alloy melts\nSolidification and Crystallization Processing in Metals and Alloys features many solved examples in the text, and exercises (with answers) for students. Intended for Masters and PhD students as well as researchers in Materials Science, Engineering, Chemistry and Metallurgy, it is also a valuable resource for engineers in industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de004e2543c4f24fcd238fa37e8312e09271be84","amp;dn":"Solidification+and+Crystallization+Processing+in+Metals+n+Alloys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de004e2543c4f24fcd238fa37e8312e09271be84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,0,78,37,67,196,242,79,205,35,143,163,126,131,18,224,146,113,190,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
