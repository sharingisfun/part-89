Yet the better-known studies of time and instinct, existentialism, phenomenology, and organism are also represented.\nPhilosophy in the 20th century is by no means remote from the concerns of the ordinary man and the problems of culture. In his introduction and commentary, Morton White illustrates this, and illuminates the background of the selections themselves.\nThe 20th century philosophers included are: Peirce, Whitehead, James, Dewey, Bertrand Russell, Wittgenstein, Croce, Bergson, Sartre and Santayana","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2661928beca190da8f82c2598c79497cb41ca0f","amp;dn":"The+age+of+analysis+-+20th+century+philosophers.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2661928beca190da8f82c2598c79497cb41ca0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,102,25,40,190,202,25,13,168,248,44,37,152,199,148,151,203,65,202,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
