The band has released three albums: Big Moon Ritual, The Magic Door, and Phosphorescent Harvest. The band consists of Robinson, guitarist Neal Casal, keyboardist Adam MacDougall, bassist Mark Dutton, and drummer Tony Leone (who replaced original drummer George Sluppick in January 2015).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFormation And Big Moon Ritual:\n\nChris Robinson Brotherhood began as an experiment but became a 'band' during their California residency tour. The original intention, according to Robinson, was to &quot;have a local L.A. band, just play in California, see where the music takes us and have a good time.&quot; They then embarked on an 118 date North American tour in 2011. Robinson names Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh and Bob Weir, who sat in with the band during CRB's run at the Great American Music Hall, as both musical inspirations and friends. As well as Robinson, the band features fellow Black Crowes member Adam MacDougall, Ryan Adams collaborator Neal Casal, bassist Mark Dutton, and drummer George Sluppick. Robinson describes the Brotherhood as a &quot;farm-to-table psychedelic band&quot;.\n\nChris Robinson Brotherhood released a version of &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; (written by Carl Perkins) b/w a live version &quot;Girl, I Love You&quot; (written by Al Bell and Eddie Floyd) for Record Store Day on April 21, 2012. The CD version also features a cover of the Jimmy Reed song, &quot;Bright Lights Big City&quot;.\n\nThe band's debut album, Big Moon Ritual, was recorded at Sunset Sound Studios, Los Angeles, and was released on June 5, 2012. Chris Robinson suggests that Big Moon Ritual is &quot;not a concept album, but it's very conceptual sonically.&quot; He also notes that CRB &quot;isn't the type of band that's going to make a concise four-minute song record&quot; and that they prefer instead to make lengthier compositions.\nBig Moon Ritual is the debut studio album by American blues rock band Chris Robinson Brotherhood. It was released on 5 June 2012, and was recorded at the same time as their second album, The Magic Door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChris Robinson Brotherhood:\n---------------------------\n\nChris Robinson: lead vocals, guitar\nNeal Casal: guitar, vocals\nAdam MacDougall: keyboards, vocals\nMark Dutton: bass, vocals\nGeorge Sluppick: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9229905848c32f8b8ba8ce46ea9dc965d878e38","amp;dn":"Chris+Robinson+Brotherhood+-+Big+Moon+Ritual+%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9229905848c32f8b8ba8ce46ea9dc965d878e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,34,153,5,132,140,50,248,184,186,140,228,110,169,220,150,93,135,142,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
