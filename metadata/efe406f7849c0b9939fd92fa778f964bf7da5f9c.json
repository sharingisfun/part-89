They wake up one morning to that there is no electricity, water or telephone service. When Joshua tries to leave their suburban neighborhood, he finds their way is blocked by an electrical field of some kind. Sarah has plans to run off but she meets an alien creature who is dying and she too is infected. Joshua eventually learns the truth: their entire neighborhood has been carried off to a distant planet to see if humans would be suitable as slave labor. For Joshua, there is only one course of action available to the survivors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe406f7849c0b9939fd92fa778f964bf7da5f9c","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits+-+Feasibility+Study","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe406f7849c0b9939fd92fa778f964bf7da5f9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,228,6,247,132,156,11,153,57,253,146,250,119,143,150,75,247,218,95,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
