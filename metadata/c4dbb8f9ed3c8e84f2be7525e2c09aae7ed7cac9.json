Bartlett previously created Hey Arnold!, and worked on Rugrats, Sid the Science Kid, and the Penny cartoons for Pee-wee's Playhouse.\n\nThe series features a curious young Tyrannosaurus Rex named Buddy who, together with his adopted Pteranodon family, takes the Dinosaur Train to explore his time period, and have adventures with all kinds of dinosaurs. It is produced by The Jim Henson Company in association with Media Development Authority, Sparky Animation, FableVision, and Snee-Oosh, Inc.\n\nThe show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train can be customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long-necked sauropods, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by Troodons, as the smartest dinosaurs in this fictional universe. The Dinosaur Train circles the whole worldÃ¢â‚¬â€it even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It can travel through the entire Mesozoic Era, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Age of Dinosaurs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ passing through magical Time Tunnels to the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods.\n\nThe world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy the Tyrannosaurus. In the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Pteranodon. He hatched at the same time as his pteranodon siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, supplied with all dinosaur facts by the trainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Troodon Conductor, Buddy learns that he is a Tyrannosaurus. As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is curious about the differences between species and vows to learn about all the dinosaurs he can by riding the Dinosaur Train. The dinosaurs featured in the show are actual dinosaurs discovered by paleontologists.\n\nI noticed that PBS Kids was running the final two episodes of season 3 this week, the first new episodes to air since August 2014, so I recorded and encoded them. Dinosaur Train has been renewed for a fourth season of 10 episodes to premiere in Late 2015 or Early 2016.\n\nIf you'd like me to post more episodes of Dinosaur Train, please leave me a thank-you comment! After your download completes, please leave the torrent open for as long as possible so that it will be fully seeded for others to enjoy. I'm still busily getting caught up on encoding shows since TPB came back, but I notice there are quite a few episodes that aren't on TPB yet.\n\nCheck out my video collecting blog: nantovision at blog spot dot com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4dbb8f9ed3c8e84f2be7525e2c09aae7ed7cac9","amp;dn":"Dinosaur+Train+%28PBS+Kids%29+Season+3%2C+Episodes+12-13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4dbb8f9ed3c8e84f2be7525e2c09aae7ed7cac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,219,184,249,237,60,142,132,242,190,117,37,226,192,154,174,126,215,202,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
