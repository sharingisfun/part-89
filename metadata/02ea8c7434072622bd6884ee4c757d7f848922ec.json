In the hugely successful 1952 biopic starring Susan Hayward, it was Froman's voice that was heard on the sound-track, and it made her an international star overnight. Until then her career had been confined to American radio and night-clubs, with only occasional appearances on the Broadway stage and just two Hollywood movies, neither of particular merit.\n\nJane Froman - 01] My Melancholy Baby 3.09\nJane Froman - 02] I Only Have Eyes for You 3.11\nJane Froman - 03] You Let Me Down 2.43\nJane Froman - 04] Lost in a Fog 3.07\nJane Froman - 05] But Where Are You? 2.56\nJane Froman - 06] Medley: Summertime/It Ain't Necessarily So 4.07\nJane Froman - 07] Please Believe Me 2.46\nJane Froman - 08] If You Love Me 3.13\nJane Froman, Sonny Schuyler - 09] Medley: Maybe/Do Do Do/Clap Yo' Hands/Someone to Watch over Me 3.59\nJane Froman - 10] The Man I Love 4.11\nJane Froman, Frank Black, NBC Concert Orchestra - 11] Did I Remember? 2.48\nJane Froman - 12] Speak Your Heart 4.00\nJane Froman, Frank Black, NBC Concert Orchestra - 13] La Bomba 3.21\nJane Froman - 14] Boy!
