They use three gifted humans (called &quot;Pre-Cogs&quot;) with special powers to see into the future and predict crimes beforehand. John Anderton heads Precrime and believes the system's flawlessness steadfastly. However one day the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will commit a murder himself in the next 36 hours. Worse, Anderton doesn't even know the victim. He decides to get to the mystery's core by finding out the 'minority report' which means the prediction of the female Pre-Cog Agatha that &quot;might&quot; tell a different story and prove Anderton innocent. \n\n\n\n\n ***** As Always, My Thanks in advance to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is much appreciated *****\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2839d084db2049330b5ecb32cb7c8f200203794","amp;dn":"Minority+Report+%282Disc+Special+Edition%29+Multi+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2839d084db2049330b5ecb32cb7c8f200203794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,131,157,8,77,178,4,147,48,181,236,179,44,183,200,242,0,32,55,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
