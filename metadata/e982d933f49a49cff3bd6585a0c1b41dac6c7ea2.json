Born in Britain on December 20, 1948, he began his musical career as a staff engineer at EMI Studios, and first garnered significant industry exposure via his work on the Beatles' 1969 masterpiece, Abbey Road. Parsons subsequently worked with Paul McCartney on several of Wings' earliest albums; he also oversaw recordings from Al Stewart, Cockney Rebel, and Pilot, but solidified his reputation by working on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. \n\n\nGenre................: Progressive Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Arista\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nCD1\n\n 01.The Raven\n 02.(The System Of) Dr. Tarr And Professor Fether\n 03.To One In Paradise\n 04.I Robot\n 05.I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\n 06.Some Other Time\n 07.Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\n 08.What Goes Up\n 09.The Eagle Will Rise Again\n 10.In The Lap Of The Gods\n 11.Lucifer\n 12.Damned If I Do\n 13.Games People Play\n 14.Time\n\nThe Turn Of A Friendly Card (Suite)\n \n 15.The Turn Of A Friendly Card (Part I)\n 16.Snake Eyes\n 17.The Ace Of Swords\n 18.Nothing Left To Lose\n 19.The Turn Of A Friendly Card (Part II)\n\n\nCD2\n\n 01.Sirius\n 02.Eye In The Sky\n 03.Silence And I\n 04.Old And Wise\n 05.Mammagamma\n 06.Prime Time\n 07.Ammonia Avenue\n 08.Don't Answer Me\n 09.Let's Talk About Me\n 10.Days Are Numbers (The Traveller)\n 11.No Answers Only Questions (Previously Unreleased)\n 12.Stereotomy\n 13.Limelight\n 14.La Sagrada Familia\n 15.Standing On Higher Ground\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e982d933f49a49cff3bd6585a0c1b41dac6c7ea2","amp;dn":"Alan+Parsons+Project+-+The+Essential+%282007%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e982d933f49a49cff3bd6585a0c1b41dac6c7ea2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,130,217,51,244,154,73,207,243,189,101,133,160,193,180,29,172,108,126,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
