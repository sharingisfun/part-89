This collection analyzes the foreign policies of the post-Yugoslav states focusing on the main goals, actors, decision-making processes and influences on the foreign policies of these countries. It demonstrates how internal and external developments help to explain why their foreign policy, and with it EU integration, have proceeded so differently. Country experts analyze the seven states that emerged from the former Yugoslavia and point towards unique developments in these countries that have had a profound impact on their foreign policy. From Kosovo's struggle for recognition to Macedonia's name dispute with Greece, this volume discusses foreign policy from a unique insider perspective, thereby offering an original analysis of decision-making processes and foreign policy instruments in the post-Yugoslav states.\n\nNumber of pages: 280\n\nISBN13: 9781137384126\n\nISBN10: 1137384123\n\nFormat: PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af4b25cbaf7effb7bcb33657075fd32569c19bd5","amp;dn":"The+Foreign+Policies+of+Post-Yugoslav+States+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af4b25cbaf7effb7bcb33657075fd32569c19bd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,75,37,203,175,126,255,183,188,179,54,87,7,95,211,37,105,193,155,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
