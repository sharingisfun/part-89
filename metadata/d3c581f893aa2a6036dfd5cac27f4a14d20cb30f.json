The series is created by Tim McKeon and Adam Peltzman and is co-produced by The Fred Rogers Company and Sinking Ship Entertainment in association with TVOKids and Ici Radio-Canada TÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©. Geared for children ages 5-8, &quot;Odd Squad&quot; follows two young agents, Olive and Otto, who are part of an agency that seeks to save the day using math when odd things happen. The young agents use indirect reasoning and math to solve and investigate strange happenings in their town. This is commonly in the form of satire, or other comedic archetypes, and are used to teach the audience differing lessons in mathematics. In the UK it airs on CBBC.\n\nFor some reason none of the public trackers I checked seemed to have the most recent episodes which aired from March-May of 2015, so I decided to upload them myself. If you'd like me to post more episodes of Odd Squad, please leave me a thank-you comment! After your download completes, please leave the torrent open for as long as possible so that it will be fully seeded for others to enjoy. If people continue to seed, I will post new episodes when they are shown.\n\nCheck out my video collecting blog: nantovision at blog spot dot com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3c581f893aa2a6036dfd5cac27f4a14d20cb30f","amp;dn":"Odd+Squad+%28PBS+Kids%29+Season+1%2C+Episodes+22-28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3c581f893aa2a6036dfd5cac27f4a14d20cb30f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,197,129,248,147,170,42,96,54,223,213,202,194,127,74,20,210,12,179,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
