This installer does not require a crack, simply run it after downloading.    \n\nI have thoroughly tested this in Prepar3d 2.5 and everything works perfectly, including the configuration program.    The main files themselves MIGHT work in FSX via a manual rip install, but I don't think the configuration program will work properly in a FSX install, however    If anyone is able to get a working installation into FSX properly, please post your results here.\n\nAgain, everything WORKS perfectly in P3D 2.5, including the configuration program.  Despite all of Realair's hype about how much they've improved the V2 Turbine Duke over the V1 Turbine Duke, I can't really see a damn bit of difference except maybe that this V2 has landing lights built into the .mdl file (gives actual illumination to 3d objects at night).     \n\nEnjoy this!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deb99080a20b99338a2293d53bfc9bac5c446695","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+++Realair+Turbine+Duke+Version+2+for+P3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deb99080a20b99338a2293d53bfc9bac5c446695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,185,144,128,162,11,153,51,138,34,147,213,59,252,155,172,92,68,102,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
